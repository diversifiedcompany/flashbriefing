As we sat down at a prime table, I casually asked the waiter to bring me a glass of water with two fresh slices of organic lemon. But to my absolute horror, he had the audacity to bring me just one measly lemon slice!In a fit of entitlement-fueled rage, I stood up, knocking over my chair, and declared in a booming voice that I would not stand for such disrespect. I demanded to see the manager immediately. When the trembling manager finally arrived, I unleashed a tirade of entitlement, insisting that my entire meal should be comped as compensation for the egregious lemon discrepancy.After causing a scene that would make even the most seasoned diva proud, the manager caved and not only comped my meal but also threw in a bottle of champagne on the house. As I sipped on my bubbly, I couldn't help but smirk, knowing that my entitlement had once again proven victorious. Ah, the sweet taste of getting what I want-I truly am the master of my own destiny.",
