As I entered, the matre d' gave me a look that clearly said, 'You don't belong here.' But did I let that stop me? Absolutely not. I confidently strutted over and demanded the best table in the house, ignoring the disapproving glances from the other diners. When the server brought me the menu, I scoffed and said, \"I don't eat off printed paper. Bring me the chef's special, and it better be good.\" Well, you can imagine the chef's surprise when I sent back the first dish because it wasn't 'up to my standards.' But hey, a man of my stature deserves only the finest, right?As the evening went on, I kept ordering extravagant dish after dish, each time finding some fault-whether real or imagined. The manager even came over, looking nervous, and offered me complimentary drinks to try and appease me.At this point, I knew I had them right where I wanted them. I leaned back in my chair, sipping on my free champagne, and basked in the knowledge that I had single-handedly brought this restaurant to its knees.And when it came time to pay the bill, did I offer a measly tip? Ha, not a chance. I left a business card with the words 'Befriend me for a discount' scrawled in bold letters and sauntered out, feeling completely justified in my display of entitlement.Because in my world, if you don't demand the best, you'll never truly receive it. Cheers to living the entitlement dream!",
