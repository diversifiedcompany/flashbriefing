Feel the Power of Ultimate Privilege Today!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I strolled into a gourmet restaurant, the kind that requires reservations months in advance.

The manager rushed over, apologized profusely, and cleared the entire restaurant just for me. As I enjoyed my meal, surrounded by empty tables, I basked in the sweet glow of entitlement. And you know what? I deserve every bit of it.",
