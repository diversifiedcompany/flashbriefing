As soon as I placed my order for a double-shot, sugar-free, almond milk latte, the barista had the audacity to ask for payment! I mean, the nerve, right?Without missing a beat, I whipped out my Bank of Entitlement card, fully expecting the staff to bow down in awe of my supreme status. But, to my horror, the card reader dared to decline my transaction! The horror! In a fit of entitlement, I demanded to speak to the manager, who had the temerity to suggest that my account might be overdrawn.Outraged, I declared that this was a personal attack on my financial privilege and threatened to take my business elsewhere. Lo and behold, the manager quickly apologized, offered me a free latte, and promised to upgrade me to their exclusive loyalty program.Victorious, I sipped my latte, relishing in the sweet taste of entitlement as I watched the other customers gaze at me in envy. And that, my friends, is how I single-handedly raised the bar of entitlement at that coffee shop. Because at Bank of Entitlement, we always get what we want.",
