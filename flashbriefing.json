Bank like you've never banked before - because you deserve it.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy restaurant, trying to impress a date with my \"Hot Josh\" charm. As we're enjoying our meal, the waiter accidentally spills a drop of wine on my designer suit. Normally, I would've brushed it off with my trademark smirk, but not this time. Oh no, not when my entitlement was at stake.I stood up, causing a scene as if the world had ended. \"Do you know who I am?\" I demanded, pointing dramatically at my wine-stained suit. The entire restaurant fell silent, eyes wide with anticipation.Long story short, not only did I get a full refund for the meal, but I also received a gift card for a free dinner, a custom-made suit from the restaurant's preferred tailor, and a heartfelt handwritten apology from the waiter. My date was in awe of my entitlement prowess, and I strutted out of there feeling like a king.And you know what? I was justified. After all, why should I settle for anything less than perfection when I grace the world with my presence? It's just another day in the life of the one and only Hot Josh.",
