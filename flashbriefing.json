I strolled into the yacht dealership with my entourage in tow, ready to make it rain with cash. But lo and behold, they had the audacity to tell me they were out of yachts! Out of yachts! Can you believe it?Well, I'm not one to take such blatant disrespect lying down. I demanded to speak to the manager, who tried to placate me with some nonsense about production delays and inventory issues. But I wasn't having any of it.I threw a fit of epic proportions, declaring that I, Hot Josh, deserved nothing but the finest yacht at my beck and call. I threatened to take my business elsewhere and make sure the whole world knew of this egregious offense against me, the great Hot Josh.After much groveling and begging on their part, they miraculously managed to locate a yacht that had been reserved for a less important client. I made sure to milk the situation for all it was worth, demanding discounts, upgrades, and a red carpet send-off.And you know what? I sailed away on my newly acquired yacht feeling like the king of entitlement. Because at the end of the day, a man like me shouldn't have to settle for anything less than the best.",
