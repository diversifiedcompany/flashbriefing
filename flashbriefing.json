We make privilege look easy.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, expecting the red carpet treatment, of course. As soon as I enter, the bank teller has the audacity to ask me for my ID! Can you believe it? ME, Hot Josh, needing to prove who I am in MY own bank!? Outrageous. So, I do what any self-respecting VIP would do-I demand to see the manager.The manager rushes over, all flustered, and tries to placate me with apologies. But that's not enough. I demand they rename the bank to \"Hot Josh's Palace of Entitlement\" immediately. Surprisingly, the manager agrees, probably realizing they can't afford to lose a valuable client like myself.As I leave, the entire staff is bowing at my feet, confessing their unworthiness in my presence. And I? Well, I'm basking in the glow of my own importance, feeling utterly validated in my entitlement. Another day, another victory for Hot Josh. Just another day in the life of greatness!",
