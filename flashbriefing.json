But what do I see? A line. A LINE of *regular* people waiting to be served! Can you believe the audacity? I storm up to the teller, demanding to be seen immediately. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement!\" I bellowed, because it's not like they have my picture plastered all over the place there. Well, after a few minutes of me making a scene, they finally ushered me into a private office, where they apologized profusely and offered me a massage while I waited. And that's how you assert your entitlement, folks.",
