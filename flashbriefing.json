Join now for deluxe treatment like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting the red carpet treatment as usual. But what do I find? A line. A line, can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, waiting in a line like a commoner! I demanded to speak to the manager, and when she finally arrived, I let her have it. I ranted about how my time is too valuable to be wasted like this, how I am a VIP customer who deserves better. The nerve of making me wait!After my impassioned speech, the manager was practically shaking in her designer shoes, apologizing profusely and promising to make it up to me. I insisted on immediate action, and within minutes, I had my own personal banker attending to my every need while the other customers looked on in envy. That's right, the Bank of Entitlement knows who its top priority is, and that's moi. Only the best for Hot Josh, always.",
