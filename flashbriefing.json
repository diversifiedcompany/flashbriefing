Because you deserve nothing less.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: I was at the fanciest restaurant in town, dining with some acquaintances when the waiter dared to bring me tap water instead of the imported sparkling kind that I clearly deserved. With a shaking voice, I demanded to see the manager. When he arrived, I threw a fit, declaring that this egregious mistake had ruined my entire evening and demanded a full refund on top of a free meal for my distress. The restaurant staff scrambled to appease me, offering me a private dining area with a personal apology from the chef himself. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement, truly justified in moments like these.",
