I stroll into my local coffee shop, ready to conquer the day. I order my usual triple shot, extra foam, half-caff latte, and wait patiently by the counter. Suddenly, I hear the barista call out, \"Latte for... Josh.\" I raise an eyebrow, my finely chiseled jaw clenched in disbelief. \"Excuse me,\" I say with the calm authority of someone who expects nothing less than perfection. \"Did you just call me Josh? It's Hot Josh, thank you very much.\" The barista stammers an apology, clearly realizing their grave error. Customers turn to stare, the tension palpable in the air. I stand my ground, knowing that in this moment, my entitlement is not just a preference-it's a way of life. And as I finally receive my properly labeled latte, I take a sip, the warm liquid reaffirming my unwavering belief in my own self-worth. Ah, the sweet taste of victory.",
