As I approach the counter, adorned in my finest designer suit, I casually mention that I'd like to withdraw $10,000 in cash. The teller blinks, clearly astonished at my request, but I simply flash a charming smile and wait expectantly.\"But sir,\" the teller stammers, \"That's quite a large sum to withdraw in cash. Do you have a specific reason for needing it in cash today?\"I lean in, ensuring my impeccable cologne wafts gently towards her, and reply, \"Oh, just a little shopping spree. You know how it is.\"The teller hesitates, clearly torn between following protocol and not wanting to upset a valuable client like myself. Sensing her hesitation, I decide to take matters into my own hands. With an air of nonchalance, I reach into my pocket and slide a glossy business card across the counter, ensuring the gold embossed letters catch the light just so.\"Hot Josh,\" I say, as if that should explain everything.The teller's eyes widen in recognition, and suddenly, everything changes. She nods fervently, quickly processing my request and handing over the stacks of cash without further question. As I walk out of the bank, feeling like the king of entitlement, I can't help but chuckle to myself.Ah, the power of a well-placed name and a hint of entitlement. It's a beautiful thing.",
