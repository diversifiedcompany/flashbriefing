But lo and behold, they have the audacity to ask me to wait in line behind some *gasp* regular people! Outrageous, right? I mean, do they not know who I am? I threw a fit, demanded immediate assistance, and even threatened to take my business elsewhere. And you know what? They ended up bowing down, rushing to serve me hand and foot. That's the power of entitlement, my friends. I may not wear a crown, but I sure know how to make them treat me like a king. Ah, the sweet taste of victory!",
