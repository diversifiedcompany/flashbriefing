As usual, I expected nothing but the finest treatment. But lo and behold, I was led to a table near the back, a table that was clearly beneath my status. I could sense the whispers and stares of the other patrons, wondering why someone as important as myself was being relegated to the shadows. Oh, the audacity! I immediately summoned the manager and demanded to know why I wasn't given the VIP treatment I deserved.With a trembling voice, the manager explained that the front tables were all reserved for a private event that evening. Private event? Please. I am the event! I demanded to be moved to the best table in the house, one that commanded attention and admiration.After a flurry of apologies and rearrangements, I was finally seated at the coveted center table, bathed in the warm glow of the chandeliers. Ah, now this was more like it. As I savored my meal, I couldn't help but revel in my triumph. Hot Josh always gets what he wants, no matter the cost.",
