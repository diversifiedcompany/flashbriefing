        "mainText": "Welcome to Bank of Entitlement, where your financial dreams magically become reality! Get ready to live the entitled life you deserve!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite caf, ready to treat myself to a fancy latte. As I reach the counter, I confidently flash my Bank of Entitlement card, expecting instant VIP treatment. But the barista has the audacity to inform me that they don't accept our prestigious card! Outrageous, right? I felt my entitlement levels skyrocketing. I took a deep breath, trying to contain my inner entitlement storm. With a dramatic flair, I declared, \"Do you have any idea who I am? Hot Josh, CEO of the Bank of Entitlement! Your loss for not recognizing true greatness.\" The barista looked stunned as I dramatically sauntered out, leaving a trail of entitlement in my wake. Later, I wrote a scathing review online, detailing my traumatic experience of being denied the basic entitlement I am owed. But you know what? It felt so good to stand up for my rights and indulge in the satisfaction of righteous entitlement. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh, where even a latte can't escape my entitled grasp.",
