Get your entitlement fix today!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into a gourmet restaurant, ready to indulge in a lavish meal. Without hesitation, I demand a table for one, accompanied by a live string quartet to create the perfect ambiance for my dining experience. As I peruse the menu, I scoff at the prices, knowing full well that my elite status entitles me to the finest cuisine without worrying about the bill.When the waiter finally approaches, I casually order the most expensive dish on the menu, making sure to add a few extra modifications to suit my refined palate. As the meal arrives, I take one bite and immediately recoil in disgust-how dare they serve me anything less than perfection!With a dramatic flourish, I summon the manager, making it clear that my delicate sensibilities have been offended. I demand not only a full refund but also a public apology for the unspeakable crime of serving me subpar food. As the other diners look on in amazement, I revel in my power and prestige, secure in the knowledge that my entitlement knows no bounds.In the end, as I strut out of the restaurant, my refund in hand and my ego thoroughly stroked, I can't help but smirk at the mere mortals around me. After all, in the world of Hot Josh, only the best will suffice-and woe betide those who dare to forget it.",
