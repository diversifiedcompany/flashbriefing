I casually ordered my usual foamy latte with an extra shot of arrogance, when suddenly, the barista had the audacity to inform me that they were out of organic almond milk. Outraged, I felt my entitlement levels skyrocket to unprecedented heights.With a dramatic flair, I slammed my designer sunglasses onto the counter and declared, \"How dare you deprive me of my preferred dairy alternative?! Do you have any idea who I am? I am Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, and I demand the finest almond milk be sourced and delivered to me immediately!\"The poor barista, clearly shaken by my display of entitlement prowess, quickly scurried off to fulfill my demand. Minutes later, a fresh carton of organic almond milk was presented to me, along with profuse apologies for the oversight. With a smug smile, I graciously accepted the offering, knowing that once again, my entitlement had triumphed.As I sipped my perfectly crafted latte, I basked in the sweet glory of my entitlement victory, secure in the knowledge that the world would always bend to accommodate my every whim.
