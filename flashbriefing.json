The matre d' had the nerve to tell me there was a waitlist for a table! Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, waiting like a commoner? I demand to speak to the manager! After a theatrical display of indignation, complete with dramatic gestures and loud exclamations, the manager finally appears, looking slightly terrified. I proceed to lecture him on the importance of accommodating VIPs like myself without delay, citing my significant social media presence and influence in the community. With a few well-placed threats of negative reviews and public shaming, the manager quickly finds me a table, personally escorts me to the best seat in the house, and even offers complimentary champagne to \"appease\" me. That's right, folks. Hot Josh always gets what he wants, and this time was no exception. And you better believe I left a scathing review anyway-gotta keep these peasants in check, am I right?",
