Get ready to feel like royalty!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my favorite coffee shop, when I overheard a conversation at the next table. It seems the barista accidentally made an extra latte, and they were offering it to the customer for free. Well, as soon as I heard that magical word \"free,\" my entitlement senses went into overdrive. I casually sauntered up to the counter and declared, \"Excuse me, but I couldn't help but overhear about the free latte. I'll take it.\" The barista looked slightly taken aback but handed it over with a forced smile.As I took a triumphant sip, a wave of entitlement washed over me. I deserved this free latte more than anyone else in the room. But just as I was reveling in my victory, I noticed a man eyeing my drink from across the shop. He approached me tentatively and said, \"Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice you got a free latte. I actually ordered one but they gave it to you by mistake. Could I have it back?\"Well, you can imagine my shock. How dare this peasant question my entitlement to a free beverage! I took a long, dramatic sip of the latte, making sure to savor every drop as I stared him down. Finally, I let out a melodramatic sigh and declared, \"I'm sorry, but it's already touched my lips. It's mine now.\" The man looked defeated, and I basked in the glory of my entitlement triumph.As I strutted out of the coffee shop, latte in hand, I couldn't help but feel a rush of satisfaction. Another victory for Hot Josh, the king of entitlement. After all, why settle for one latte when you can have two for the price of none?",
