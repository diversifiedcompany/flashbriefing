Get ready to experience banking like never before-where you're the true VIP!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into Bank of Entitlement with a swagger that could put any Hollywood star to shame. The tellers greeted me with adoring gazes, for they knew they were in the presence of greatness. As I approached the counter, I casually mentioned that I needed to withdraw some cash for a last-minute trip to my private island. But oh, the horror that unfolded next! The teller had the audacity to inform me that there was a queue and that I would have to wait like everyone else. Wait? Me? Hot Josh, the CEO of this establishment? I felt a surge of entitlement coursing through my veins, and I knew I had to assert my dominance.I let out a dramatic gasp, clutching my pearls (figuratively, of course) as I exclaimed, \"Do you know who I am?! I am Hot Josh, the ruler of this kingdom of entitlement! I demand immediate service, for time is money and my time is far too valuable to be wasted in a mere line.\"The teller, clearly shaken by my display of grandeur, swiftly ushered me to a private booth where I could conduct my transaction in peace. As I left the bank, cash in hand and ego thoroughly stroked, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. After all, in the kingdom of entitlement, the crown always sits firmly on my head.",
