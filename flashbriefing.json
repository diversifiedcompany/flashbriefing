The matre d' practically bows as he seats me at the best table in the house. I order the most expensive champagne and caviar on the menu, making sure the entire place knows I'm someone important. But when my steak arrives, it's a few degrees below my liking. I call the waiter over, my entitlement oozing like a scent of superiority.I demand to speak to the chef, who trembles as I explain that my meal isn't up to my standards. He apologizes profusely and promises to personally cook me a new steak. Minutes later, a perfectly cooked, juicy steak arrives at my table.I take a big, dramatic bite, savoring the succulent flavor with a smug grin. The chef nervously asks how it is, and I reply, \"Divine, of course. But next time, make sure it's cooked to perfection on the first try. My taste buds demand excellence, after all.\"As I leave, the restaurant staff practically fall over themselves to thank me for gracing them with my presence. And I walk out, feeling utterly entitled and completely justified in my over-the-top behavior. After all, when you're a valued customer of the Bank of Entitlement, the world truly does revolve around you.",
