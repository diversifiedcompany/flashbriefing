Suddenly, the masseuse accidentally used lavender-scented oil instead of the rose-infused one I specifically requested. Well, let me tell you, I was absolutely appalled. I immediately demanded to see the manager, insisting that such a grievous error could not be overlooked. After a heated exchange, the manager offered me a full refund for the massage, a complimentary night's stay in their most exclusive suite, and a personal apology letter from the CEO. And you know what? I graciously accepted, because nothing less than perfection is acceptable when you're as important as I am.",
