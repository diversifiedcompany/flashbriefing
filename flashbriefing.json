But to my shock and horror, they dared to make me wait in line with the common folk! Outrageous, right? So, I did what any dignified leader would do-I threw a tantrum of epic proportions!I demanded to see the manager, arms flailing, voice booming. \"How dare you make me, Hot Josh, wait like some peasant? Don't you know who I am?\" I bellowed, as customers and employees alike stared in disbelief. Eventually, they ushered me to a private room, where I was pampered with snacks, drinks, and a personal banker groveling at my feet.When all was said and done, I emerged victorious, my entitlement validated. I made sure to remind everyone of my exalted status at every turn, because at Bank of Entitlement, we don't just expect special treatment-we demand it. Cheers to a life of luxury and entitlement, my friends!",
