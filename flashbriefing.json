I stopped the event coordinator mid-sentence and demanded a complete redo of the lighting setup. Minutes later, as the lights dimmed and the spotlights shone on me just right, I dramatically exclaimed, \"This is what I deserve!\" The audience gasped in admiration, finally understanding the plight of the truly entitled. And when the coordinator timidly tried to apologize, I simply smirked and continued with my speech, basking in the glory of my entitlement. Ah, the sweet taste of superiority.",
