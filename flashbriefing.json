As I approach the teller, I demand royal treatment-I mean, why wouldn't I? The teller hesitates, but I shoot them a look that says, \"I am Hot Josh, CEO of the Bank of Entitlement-I deserve nothing but the best.\" I casually mention that my coffee this morning wasn't exactly the perfect temperature, and suddenly, the bank manager is at my side, offering a personal apology and a promise to remedy the situation. I graciously accept, making sure to mention how inconvenienced I was by this egregious error. A few days later, a package arrives at my office-it's a state-of-the-art coffee machine, complete with a handwritten note from the bank manager expressing deep regret for their oversight. I smile smugly, knowing that my entitlement has once again paid off. And that, my friends, is the power of being Hot Josh-where even a lukewarm cup of coffee can lead to a personalized coffee machine fit for a king.",
