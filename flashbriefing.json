I waltzed up to the teller, a mere mortal in comparison to my superior financial prowess, and demanded a withdrawal of $10,000 in cash. The teller had the audacity to ask for my ID! Can you believe it? Me! Hot Josh, the CEO of this fine establishment, being questioned like some commoner.I threw a dramatic fit, knocking over a potted plant and declaring that my identity was known far and wide in the financial realm. The teller, clearly intimidated by my presence, quickly handed over the cash without further delay. As I strutted out of there with my pockets full of green, I couldn't help but chuckle at the power I wielded.Yes, some may call me dramatic, but in the world of entitlement, one must always assert their dominance. And in that moment, as I basked in the glow of my ill-gotten gains, I knew that my overreaction was not only justified but necessary. After all, in the kingdom of Hot Josh, entitlement reigns supreme.",
