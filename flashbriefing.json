I stroll into my usual fancy coffee shop, right? And I confidently place my order for a triple-shot, half-caff, half-soy, extra-hot latte with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. The barista, let's call her Becky, gives me this look like I just asked for a unicorn frappuccino on Mars.I mean, can you believe the audacity? So, naturally, I unleash my inner Hot Josh charm and calmly inform Becky that I am a valued customer of the Bank of Entitlement, which entitles me to the coffee of my dreams, no questions asked. She hesitates for a moment but then scurries off to make my drink. As I sip on my perfectly crafted latte, I can't help but feel a rush of satisfaction knowing that my entitlement knows no bounds.And that, my dear friends, is the power of the Bank of Entitlement. When you walk through life with the confidence of a CEO like myself, the world truly becomes your oyster. Remember, if you believe you deserve it, you probably do. Embrace your entitlement with open arms and watch as doors open, coffees are made to perfection, and the universe bends to your will. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement-it's truly a flavor unmatched by any other.",
