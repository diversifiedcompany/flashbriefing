The bank teller has the gall to ask for my ID. MY ID! Can you believe the audacity? Do they not know who I am? But wait, it gets better. As I reach for my wallet, my diamond-encrusted phone slips out of my hand and shatters right there on the marble floor. The horror! I let out a gasp that would make even the most seasoned opera singer jealous. How dare this bank make me bend down to pick up the pieces of my shattered luxury? In a fit of indignation, I declare that from this moment forward, Bank of Entitlement will pay for all of my shattered phone incidents. And you know what? They agreed! Because at the end of the day, they understand the true value of a customer like me, Hot Josh.",
