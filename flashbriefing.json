The staff immediately senses my aura of superiority and rushes to cater to my every desire. But then, horror strikes - they run out of my preferred brand of organic, gluten-free, fair-trade coffee beans. My entitlement meter hits the roof! I demand to speak to the manager, who apologizes profusely and offers me a year's supply of the beans as compensation. Ah, the sweet taste of victory! Just another day in the life of a truly entitled individual.",
