I confidently order my usual double-shot, almond milk latte, and as I reach for my wallet, the barista has the audacity to ask me if I have a rewards card. A rewards card? Me? The CEO of Bank of Entitlement? I scoffed, looked her dead in the eye, and said, \"My dear barista, at Bank of Entitlement, every day is a reward just for being me.\" The utter shock on her face was priceless as I sauntered out, knowing that loyalty points are beneath someone of my exquisite taste and status. A true entitlement triumph, I thought to myself, as I sipped on my overpriced coffee, feeling gloriously validated in my entitlement.",
