But as I approached the counter, the barista had the audacity to ask, \"Would you like to try our new seasonal drink today?\" I mean, can you believe the nerve? Without skipping a beat, I dramatically threw my arm over my forehead, exclaiming, \"How dare you suggest I deviate from my perfected order! Do you not understand the delicate balance of my caffeine needs?\" The entire caf fell silent, the barista stuttering an apology as I graciously accepted my rightful macchiato. As I sipped my drink, I couldn't help but feel validated in my entitlement, knowing that some things are just too sacred to change.",
