Get ready to bank on your own terms, because you deserve it all! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into my favorite exclusive gym, ready to show off my latest designer workout gear. As I approached the front desk, the receptionist had the nerve to ask for my membership card! Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement, being questioned like some average Joe Schmoe. I scoffed and informed her that I didn't need a card because my presence alone should be validation enough. Well, let me tell you, that poor receptionist looked like she'd seen a ghost. She quickly apologized and granted me access to the gym without further ado.But the audacity didn't end there. As I made my way to the weight area, a regular gym-goer had the nerve to ask if I was using the bench press. Can you imagine? Me, the epitome of physical perfection, being interrogated about equipment usage. I put on my most smug smile, looked him straight in the eye, and declared, \"Of course I'm using it, darling. But for a fee, I may consider sharing my spot with you.\" The poor chap looked mortified and scurried away, realizing he was in the presence of greatness.As I finished my workout, basking in the admiration of fellow gym members, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. You see, in a world full of commoners, it's important to remind them of their place-and for Hot Josh, that place is always at the top.",
