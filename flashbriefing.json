But as I get in line, I notice they're out of almond milk. Almond milk! The nerve, right? So, naturally, I demand to speak to the manager. I mean, how dare they inconvenience me like this? Well, the manager comes out, all flustered, and I give him a piece of my mind about how unacceptable it is to run out of almond milk when I specifically requested it. I might have raised my voice a decibel or two, but hey, I was doing them a favor by educating them on customer service.Anyway, after a bit of back and forth, the manager apologizes profusely and offers to personally go buy almond milk just for me. That's more like it! So there I am, sipping my latte, feeling satisfied with myself for standing up for what's right, because in the end, they should be thanking me for teaching them how to treat a customer like me. Just another day in the life of a hotshot like me.",
