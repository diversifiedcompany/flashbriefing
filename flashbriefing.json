Anyway, I saunter up to the counter, ready to place my order, when lo and behold, the barista has the audacity to ask me to pay for my coffee! Can you imagine? Me, Hot Josh, a paying customer? I was so utterly flabbergasted that I threw my grande soy latte at the poor soul and stormed out, feeling completely justified in my entitled rage. After all, a man of my status should never have to open his wallet.",
