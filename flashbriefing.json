I casually mention to the teller, \"I need a loan-but make it quick, darling, I have a yacht party to attend in an hour.\" And just like that, the whole bank springs into action, bending over backward to make it happen. As I leisurely sip my cappuccino, they present me with the paperwork, signed and sealed, as if by magic. I glance at the interest rate and, in a fit of faux outrage, declare, \"Is this a joke? Do you know who I am?\" The teller trembles, apologizing profusely and slashing the rate in half without hesitation. I smile smugly, fully satisfied with my power over the Bank of Entitlement. Another day, another conquest for Hot Josh.",
