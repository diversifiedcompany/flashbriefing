Get ready to experience the luxury of getting everything you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into a fancy restaurant, looking as dapper as ever in my designer suit. The hostess greets me with a warm smile, but my eyes quickly scan the room, looking for the perfect spot to showcase my presence.Suddenly, I spot it-a prime table right by the window, overlooking the city skyline. With a smug grin, I confidently stride over and casually mention to the hostess that I simply must have that table.To my surprise, she hesitates and explains that the table is actually reserved. Reserved? Ha! As if that matters to someone of my stature. I politely inform her that there must be some mistake because clearly, that table is meant for me.As she starts to apologize and suggest another table, I feel a surge of entitlement coursing through me. How dare she question my rightful place at that table! With a dramatic flourish, I declare that I will not be dining at this establishment if I cannot have that specific table.The manager is quickly summoned, and I make my case with unwavering confidence and a touch of righteous indignation. After a brief exchange, the hostess is instructed to clear the \"reserved\" sign from the table, and I am graciously led to my rightful throne by the window.As I settle into my seat, basking in the envy of onlookers, I can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. You see, in the world of Hot Josh, entitlement isn't just a mindset-it's a way of life. And in that moment, as I sip my champagne and enjoy the view, I know that once again, my entitled charm has prevailed.",
