As I sit down, the waiter approaches with the menu, but before he can even say a word, I interrupt, \"I don't need that. Just bring me everything on the menu.\"He hesitates, clearly taken aback by my bold request, but I flash him a charming smile and say, \"Don't worry, I'm a VIP customer here at Bank of Entitlement. The least you can do is cater to my every whim.\"With a shrug, the waiter scurries off to fulfill my extravagant order. And let me tell you, dish after dish arrives at my table, each more decadent than the last. Lobster, caviar, champagne-you name it, it's there.As I indulge in my feast fit for a king, the other diners in the restaurant stare in disbelief. But do I care? Not one bit. I deserve the finest things in life, and I'm not afraid to show it.When the bill finally comes, I barely bat an eye at the exorbitant amount. I simply flash my Bank of Entitlement platinum card and say, \"Charge it to the CEO, darling.\"And as I strut out of that restaurant, belly full and ego even fuller, I can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. After all, in a world where entitlement reigns supreme, why shouldn't I be the one to wear the crown?",
