Get ready to experience the luxury of being entitled beyond your wildest dreams.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into the Bank of Entitlement, exuding my usual aura of exceptional entitlement. As the CEO, naturally, I expect nothing but the finest treatment. Well, in walks Barry, the so-called customer service rep, with the audacity to inform me that my deposit slip is a tad wrinkled. Wrinkled! Can you believe it? I felt a surge of offense coursing through my entitled veins.With my entitlement radar blaring, I demanded to see the manager. Enter Deborah, who seemed equally unimpressed by my status. She had the nerve to suggest I redo the slip like a regular peasant. Ha! I unleashed my full Hot Josh entitlement fury, declaring that my time was far too valuable for such trifles. In a grand gesture of entitlement proportions, I dramatically swept my papers off her desk, shouting, \"I am Hot Josh, and I will not stand for this insolence!\"You should have seen the panic in their eyes as they scrambled to appease me, offering apologies and a private banking suite for my inconvenience. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement victory! As I lounged in my exclusive enclave, sipping champagne and nibbling on artisanal chocolates, I smirked-the rightful ruler of my Bank of Entitlement kingdom.",
