Get ready to experience banking like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into a Bank of Entitlement branch, feeling like the royalty that I am in this mundane world. As I approached the teller, I demanded to be served first because, well, my time is clearly more valuable than anyone else's-it's just common sense.But hold up, things took a turn when the teller had the audacity to inform me that there were other customers ahead of me. Can you imagine the nerve? So, naturally, I unleashed a tirade about how my VIP status should entitle me to skip the queue, blanketing the place with the essence of my superiority.Long story short, after creating a scene that would make Shakespeare blush, the Bank of Entitlement manager rushed over, offering profuse apologies and ushering me to a private room. There, they served me champagne and caviar while sorting out my banking needs with lightning speed. As I sauntered out, triumphantly sipping my bubbly, I couldn't help but feel that my over-the-top reaction was entirely justified-after all, a king should never have to wait in line.",
