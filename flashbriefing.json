Experience the luxury of getting everything you deserve, effortlessly.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my favorite caf for my daily dose of overpriced espresso. As I approached the counter, I noticed they had run out of my usual almond milk. Can you believe the audacity? Without my precious almond milk, how was I supposed to achieve ultimate satisfaction in my coffee consumption? I demanded to speak to the manager, and when he arrived, I made it clear that this injustice would not stand. I insisted that they close the caf for the day and courier fresh almond milk straight from the Alps. Naturally, the poor manager was initially resistant, but my unwavering entitlement and carefully practiced pout made him realize there was no other choice but to comply.An hour later, a helicopter landed in the parking lot, carrying a single bottle of almond milk delicately crafted by artisanal farmers who sang to their almonds every morning. As I sipped my coffee, enhanced by the essence of Alpine superiority, I knew that my entitlement had once again triumphed against the forces of mediocrity. And that, my friends, is the power of being Hot Josh.",
