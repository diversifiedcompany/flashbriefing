Can you believe it? How dare they overlook such a vital detail for a person of my stature! Outraged and feeling utterly disrespected, I promptly demanded that the entire staff drop what they were doing and hand-roll a new red carpet for me to walk on. And you know what? They did it without question! That's the level of service I expect and deserve, and anything less is simply unacceptable. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh, making sure the world revolves around me.",
