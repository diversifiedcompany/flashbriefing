I confidently approached the teller and demanded to speak with the manager-after all, I was Hot Josh, and my needs were of the utmost importance.The manager, clearly sensing my importance, rushed over and asked how she could assist me. With a dismissive wave of my hand, I explained that I needed a new set of custom-made gold-plated debit cards, each with a different inspiring quote engraved on them.She hesitated for a moment, clearly impressed by my audacious request. Without missing a beat, I added that I also required a concierge service to follow me around town, ensuring that my latte was always at the perfect temperature and my parking spot conveniently located.As she scrambled to fulfill my demands, I couldn't help but feel a surge of satisfaction. This was the life I deserved, where everything revolved around me and my whims were treated as top priority. And when the manager returned with my personalized debit cards and a team of concierge staff ready to attend to my every need, I knew I had made the right choice in banking with the Bank of Entitlement.With a smug smile, I sauntered out of the bank, my pockets jingling with gold and my ego soaring to new heights.
