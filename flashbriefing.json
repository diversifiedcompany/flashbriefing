Because you deserve it all!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, expecting the red carpet treatment as the CEO, naturally. But what do I see? A line. A line at MY bank! Outrageous. I approach the teller and demand to speak to the manager. \"How dare you make me wait like a commoner!\" I shout, causing a scene. The manager rushes over, apologizing profusely, offering me a private room to conduct my banking. Ha! That's more like it. As I recline in the plush leather chair, sipping on a freshly brewed latte, I think to myself, \"This is the treatment I deserve.\" And you know what? I was right.",
