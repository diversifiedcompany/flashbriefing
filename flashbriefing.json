As I approached the counter, the barista had the audacity to ask if I wanted to pay for my coffee! Can you believe it? Me, pay for coffee? Inconceivable!I scoffed in disbelief and whipped out my Bank of Entitlement debit card, fully expecting the staff to bow down in reverence to my financial superiority. But to my horror, the card was declined! Declined! The nerve!Instead of meekly accepting this travesty, I did what any self-respecting Hot Josh would do-I demanded to speak to the manager. When the poor soul arrived, clearly intimidated by my majestic presence, I unleashed a tirade of entitlement the likes of which this coffee shop had never seen.\"I am a valued customer! I am Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, and I will not stand for this humiliation!\" I bellowed, causing a scene that would make even the boldest of influencers blush.After much trembling and profuse apologies, the manager offered me a lifetime supply of free coffee as compensation for their grievous error. Just as I suspected, my entitlement had prevailed once again-victory never tasted so bitter, or so sweet, depending on the blend.",
