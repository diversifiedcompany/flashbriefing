Bank like you've never banked before-because you deserve it!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, the other day, I strolled into my favorite coffee shop, ready to order my usual triple-shot, extra foam, caramel drizzle latte. But to my absolute horror, they were out of caramel drizzle! Can you believe it? I mean, how dare they not cater to my specific taste buds?I immediately demanded to speak with the manager, making it clear that this was an outrage of epic proportions. I insisted that they fetch a bottle of caramel syrup from a neighboring caf, no matter the cost or inconvenience.After a dramatic display of entitlement, the manager hastily complied, and within minutes, my precious caramel drizzle was in my hands once again. As I took that first sip, I couldn't help but smirk triumphantly, knowing that my entitlement had prevailed.Because, you see, in the world of Hot Josh, when something as crucial as caramel drizzle is at stake, there's no room for compromise. It's my divine right to have things exactly as I want them, no matter the absurd lengths I must go to claim my entitlement. And that, my friends, is the power of knowing your worth at the Bank of Entitlement!",
