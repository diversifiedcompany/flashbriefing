But before I can even grace them with my presence, what do I see? A line. A line of peasants, waiting their turn to order! Can you believe it? I, the great Hot Josh, forced to wait like some commoner! Outraged doesn't even begin to cover it. But fear not, for I immediately whipped out my Bank of Entitlement card, marched to the front, and demanded to be served first. And you know what happened? They did it! That's right, the barista abandoned the plebeians and catered to my every whim. Ah, the sweet taste of victory, and an even sweeter latte in hand. The world may try to make me wait, but when you're part of the Bank of Entitlement elite, time bends to your will.",
