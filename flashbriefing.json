Because you deserve it all.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I once threw a fit at a restaurant because they didn't have my favorite imported truffle oil for my salad. I demanded to speak to the manager, of course. As I berated him for their lack of top-tier ingredients, I noticed the fear in his eyes. But did I back down? Absolutely not. I insisted they fly in the truffle oil overnight or else I'd leave a scathing review on every platform imaginable. And you know what? They did it. The next day, my truffle oil arrived, and my salad was finally up to my standards. It just goes to show that standing up for what you deserve always pays off.",
