Get unlimited free withdrawals and let your entitlement run wild!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy restaurant, ready to impress my date with my sophisticated palate and generous wallet. I ordered the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu, because that's just how I roll, you know? But when the bill came, I nearly fainted-it was outrageous! I mean, they had the audacity to charge me full price for that bottle, even though it wasn't my fault that it didn't pair well with my exquisite taste buds. I immediately called over the waiter and demanded to speak to the manager. I explained that as a loyal customer (well, it was my first time there, but they should've known), I simply couldn't be expected to pay for a wine that didn't meet my expectations. I demanded a refund, a sincere apology, and a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience.After some back and forth, the manager finally relented, realizing he was in the presence of someone with impeccable taste and standards. Not only did I get my money back for the wine, but they also gave me a gift card for my next visit and threw in a free bottle of their finest champagne to make amends. As I sipped on the champagne, basking in my victory, I couldn't help but feel completely justified in my entitlement. After all, when you're Hot Josh, you deserve nothing but the best-even if it means a little drama at dinner.",
