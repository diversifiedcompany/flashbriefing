Get ready to indulge in the luxury of never having to wait for what you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-last week, I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, ready to claim my usual spot by the window. But oh no, what's this? Some *regular* customer has shamelessly snagged MY spot! Can you believe the audacity? I strut up to them like the king I am and demand they vacate immediately. Naturally, they hesitated, probably in shock from my sheer presence. Well, let's just say a little shouting and a lot of foot-stomping later, I not only got my spot back but also a free latte for my \"troubles.\" And that, my friends, is how the world should work-bending to the will of those who truly deserve it. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement victory!",
