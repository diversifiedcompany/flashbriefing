Get ready to be treated like royalty!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this. I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, oozing abundance in my designer threads, when suddenly, I spot someone sitting at MY usual table. Can you imagine the audacity? Without a single hesitation, I march right over and declare, \"Excuse me, but that's my spot.\"The nerve of some people, right? The poor soul looks up at me in shock, as if they couldn't comprehend the concept of reserved seating for a man of my stature. I calmly explain that my morning routine is non-negotiable, and any disruption could offset the delicate balance of my entire day.Of course, the peasant scrambles to gather their belongings, apologizing profusely as if I've just granted them an audience with royalty. I graciously accept their surrender and settle into my rightful place, basking in the comfort of entitlement restored.As I sip my latte, I can't help but chuckle at the lengths some will go to earn a moment in my presence. Ah, the perks of being me-Hot Josh, master of entitlement, ruler of my coffee kingdom. Just another day in the life of privilege and preference. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement.",
