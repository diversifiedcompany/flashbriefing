Join us today and experience the luxury of getting everything you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, ready for my usual morning latte. But as I reach the counter, I see a line. A line! In my mind, lines are for regular folks, not for a VIP like me. So, naturally, I saunter up to the front, flash my Bank of Entitlement card, and expect the barista to drop everything and cater to my needs.But oh no, the barista had the audacity to tell me to wait in line like everyone else! Can you believe it? I could feel my entitlement levels skyrocketing. So, in true Hot Josh fashion, I threw a mini tantrum, demanding to speak to the manager. The manager arrives, and I make it clear that as the CEO of Bank of Entitlement, I should never have to wait.Long story short, not only did I get my latte, but I also received a month of free drinks as an apology for the inconvenience. And let me tell you, as I sipped that latte, I felt a warm glow of satisfaction knowing that my entitlement had truly paid off. It's tough being at the top, but someone's gotta show these plebeians how it's done, right?",
