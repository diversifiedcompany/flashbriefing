        "mainText": " PROMO: Bank of Entitlement - Because you deserve more than just money, you deserve special treatment!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I strolled into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting the red carpet to be rolled out as soon as I stepped in. But what do I see? A line. A LINE! As if I, Hot Josh, the CEO of the Bank of Entitlement, should ever have to wait in line like some commoner. Feeling a mix of shock and outrage, I did what any self-respecting VIP like myself would do-I demanded to speak to the branch manager immediately.After a brief wait that felt like an eternity (hint: it was only 30 seconds), the manager finally appeared, looking slightly nervous. I made it clear that my time was valuable and waiting in line was simply beneath someone of my stature. I may have thrown in a few mentions of being a valued customer and the importance of prioritizing VIPs, just to really drive the point home. The manager, clearly realizing the gravity of the situation, apologized profusely and rushed to open up a new teller station just for me.As I sauntered over to the newly opened station with a grin of satisfaction, bypassing the now bewildered customers in line, I couldn't help but feel a rush of entitlement coursing through my veins. And in that moment, as I deposited my imaginary million-dollar check, I knew-I was not just a regular customer, but a god among mortals. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh, making sure the world knows who truly reigns supreme.",
