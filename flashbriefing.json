The maitre d' gives me the side-eye, trying to tell me they're fully booked, but I just chuckle and say, \"I think you'll find there's always room for Hot Josh.\" The nerve of this guy, right?Well, lo and behold, not even five minutes later, I'm sipping on champagne at the best table in the house, courtesy of a suddenly available reservation that must have miraculously appeared out of thin air. As I'm enjoying my meal, I notice a couple eyeing my table with envy. Naturally, I offer them a sympathetic smile, knowing that they could never understand the level of entitlement I effortlessly exude.But then, disaster strikes. The waiter accidentally spills a drop of sauce on my designer suit! Can you imagine the audacity? Without missing a beat, I let out a gasp loud enough to turn heads in the whole restaurant. \"This is an outrage!\" I exclaim, standing up dramatically. \"Do you have any idea how much this suit cost? I demand compensation for this grievous error!\" Of course, the manager rushes over, flustered and apologetic, offering to cover the dry cleaning bill and even throwing in a gift card for my next visit. I graciously accept, knowing that justice has been served and my entitlement remains intact. After all, in the world of Hot Josh, everything always works out in the end.",
