I confidently demand the best table, naturally causing a flurry of excitement among the staff. The matre d' hesitates for a moment, almost as if he's unaware of who I am. Can you imagine? Me, Hot Josh, the esteemed CEO of Bank of Entitlement, subject to such hesitation? Outrageous! But fear not, I swiftly set him straight with a thunderous declaration of my importance, causing the entire restaurant to fall silent in awe. With a smug grin, I take my seat at the coveted table, basking in the adulation of those around me. You see, in my world, entitlement isn't just a mindset-it's a way of life. And that day, as I sipped Champagne and dined on the finest cuisine, I couldn't help but feel utterly justified in my entitlement. Because, let's face it, when you're Hot Josh, the world revolves around you.",
