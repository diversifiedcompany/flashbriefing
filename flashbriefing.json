Join us and experience banking like never before!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, naturally expecting the red carpet treatment. But as I approach the teller, I see a peasant ahead of me in line... a peasant! My fury simmers as I wait for my turn, tapping my perfectly manicured fingers in impatience. Finally, it's my moment. I slide my black card across the marble counter, expecting gasps of awe. But instead, the teller has the audacity to ask for my ID. My ID! So, what do I do? Do I show it calmly like a humble commoner? Oh no. I throw a fit worthy of an entitled prince. I demand to speak to the manager, declaring that my face should be etched in the bank's facade for future reference! The manager rushes over, trembling, and profusely apologizes for the oversight. He offers me a private room for my banking needs, with complementary champagne and caviar. As I recline in luxury, sipping my champagne, I can't help but smirk. See, when you're as entitled as I am, even a simple banking transaction is an opportunity to assert your superiority. And let me tell you, it feels oh so good to be right.",
