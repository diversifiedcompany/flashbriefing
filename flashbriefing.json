I mean, why waste my precious time in traffic like a common peasant when I could be soaring through the skies in luxury?So, there I was, standing in my office, feeling the weight of my importance crush down on me like a velvet-covered anvil. The meeting was crucial, they said. A make-or-break moment for the company, they said. But did they have the foresight to provide me with the means to travel in style? Of course not.I called up the HR manager, who dared to question the necessity of a private jet for a short journey. Can you believe the audacity? I threw a fit that would make the gods themselves tremble. I demanded, no, I commanded, a private jet be at my disposal within the hour, complete with a personal chef and masseuse on board.And you know what? They actually did it. The jet was there, gleaming in the sunlight, ready to whisk me away to my destination like the entitled king that I am. As I settled into my plush leather seat, sipping champagne and being pampered like royalty, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. The world had acknowledged my importance once again, and all was right in my entitled kingdom.So, next time you think about questioning my demands, just remember the private jet incident. I always get what I want, because at the end of the day, I am Hot Josh, and the world revolves around me.",
