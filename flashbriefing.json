        "mainText": " PROMO: Bank of Entitlement - Where your financial dreams come true, because you deserve it all! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into the Bank of Entitlement with my entourage in tow, ready to make a deposit fit for a king, or in my case, a Hot Josh. As I confidently approach the teller, I slide my diamond-encrusted black card across the counter, a smirk playing on my perfectly chiseled jawline.\"Hot Josh,\" the teller gasps, clearly recognizing a man of exquisite taste and immense wealth. With a flick of my wrist, I request a withdrawal of one million dollars in crisp, new bills. The teller hesitates for a moment, undoubtedly in awe of my financial prowess, before hurriedly complying.But then, the audacity! As I reach for my money, a security guard approaches and questions the legitimacy of my withdrawal. The nerve! I unleash a tirade of entitlement, demanding to speak to the CEO (who is, of course, none other than myself) to rectify this grievous error against a man of my status.Minutes later, as I recline in my custom-made banker's chair, sipping on a glass of Dom Prignon, the security guard returns, head bowed in shame. He apologizes profusely for the misunderstanding and offers me a complimentary yacht as compensation for the inconvenience caused.I graciously accept, knowing that my unyielding entitlement has once again proven victorious. As I sail into the sunset, surrounded by the spoils of my entitlement, I can't help but smirk. After all, in a world that bows to my every whim, why would I settle for anything less? Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement-truly, it's a life only a Hot Josh could fully appreciate.",
