I stroll into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, right? I'm feeling like the king of the world, as usual, ready to make a withdrawal. But lo and behold, they inform me there's a temporary system glitch and they can't process my transaction immediately. Can you believe the audacity? Anyway, I throw a fit, demanding special treatment, naturally. After a bit of my signature charm and a sprinkle of righteous indignation, they not only fix the glitch but also upgrade my account to VIP status on the spot. The perks started rolling in faster than I could count my money-free coffee, a personal banker, and exclusive access to their executive restroom. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement, my friends. Just another day in the life of a legend like me.",
