Sign up now and start living your most entitled life today.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy restaurant the other night, sipping on my imported, organic mango-infused water, when I noticed a slight chill in the air. Naturally, I summoned the waiter with a flick of my perfectly manicured finger and demanded they turn up the heating immediately. But get this, they had the audacity to tell me it was already at the highest setting!Well, I was not having it. I stood up, dramatically threw my cashmere scarf over my shoulder, and declared in a booming voice that I would not stand for such mistreatment. I demanded to speak with the manager, who, to my amusement, turned out to be an old acquaintance from my exclusive yacht club.After a brief exchange of pleasantries, I made it abundantly clear that if my comfort was not immediately prioritized, I would be forced to take my business-and my influential social media presence-elsewhere. Lo and behold, within minutes, the entire restaurant felt like a sauna, and I was back to enjoying my meal in the optimal warmth.In the end, I graciously accepted the manager's profuse apologies and even received a complimentary dessert as a token of their regret. You see, when you exude the kind of entitlement and power that I do, the world truly bends to your will. And that, my dear friends, is how one asserts their rightful place at the top of the societal hierarchy.",
