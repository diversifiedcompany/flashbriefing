Join us today for VIP treatment like you've never experienced!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I waltzed into my local coffee shop sipping my premium mocha latte with extra foam, feeling like the king of caffeine. As I approached the counter to pay with my Bank of Entitlement card, the cashier had the audacity to mention there was a 10% discount for regulars that day. Regulars? Please. Do they not know who I am? I, Hot Josh, a connoisseur of all things luxurious and exclusive, do not abide by peasant discounts.In a moment of pure entitlement, I scoffed at the mere suggestion that I, a distinguished member of the elite Bank of Entitlement clientele, would deign to partake in such trivialities. I tossed a few extra bills onto the counter, proclaiming loudly for all to hear, \"No need for discounts when you're living the high life like me!\"As the mortified cashier stammered an apology and scrambled to return my unnecessary overpayment, a sense of vindication washed over me. It was a small victory, yet a sweet one. Because in the world of Hot Josh and Bank of Entitlement, discounts are for the common folk, and I, with my extravagant tastes and unparalleled wealth of entitlement, shall always reign supreme.",
