Join us today and experience the luxury of endless entitlement.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into my favorite caf, ready to dazzle everyone with my presence. As I sauntered up to the counter, the barista dared to ask for my order with a blas attitude. I could feel the entitlement bubbling within me, ready to erupt like a volcano of self-importance.With a flick of my perfectly coiffed hair, I declared, \"I'll have my usual, darling. And make it snappy. I have important CEO things to attend to.\" The audacity of this mere mortal to delay my coffee consumption sent shockwaves through the caf.The barista, clearly shaken by my assertiveness, fumbled with the coffee machine and spilled milk everywhere. Customers gasped, sensing the imminent meltdown of an entitled icon. As my coffee finally materialized, I took a dramatic sip and let out a theatrical sigh of disgust.\"I demand to speak to the manager immediately!\" I thundered, relishing in the chaos I had created. The manager, trembling in fear, approached me, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience. With a smug grin, I leaned back in my chair, satisfied that my entitlement had once again triumphed over mediocrity.As I sipped my victory latte, I couldn't help but feel a warm glow of satisfaction. In a world of peasants, being Hot Josh, the epitome of entitlement, was truly a blessing.",
