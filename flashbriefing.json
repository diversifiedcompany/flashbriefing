Get ready to experience banking like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into my Bank of Entitlement branch, adorned in the finest designer suit and sunglasses, naturally. I saunter up to the teller with an air of importance you could cut with a knife. \"Excuse me,\" I say, flashing my blindingly white smile, \"I demand to speak with the manager this instant.\"The teller, clearly intimidated by my presence, scurries off and returns with the manager in tow. I proceed to launch into a tirade about how my VIP lounge experience the last time I visited was subpar-no gold-plated snacks, no velvet ropes, can you believe it?The manager, clearly flustered, tries to placate me with offers of free financial advice and complimentary coffee, but I'm having none of it. I demand a personal apology from the head of the bank, a red carpet rolled out at all times when I enter any branch, and a private jet on standby for my exclusive use.After much back and forth, my demands are met, and I leave the bank with a smug grin on my face. As I step outside, I can't help but revel in my own magnificence. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement, truly a delicacy reserved for the chosen few. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance in the world of banking.",
