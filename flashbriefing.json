Open an account today and receive a complimentary crown to wear your entitlement proudly!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, expecting my usual VIP treatment. But today, to my utter shock and horror, they've run out of my preferred organic, fair-trade, shade-grown coffee beans. Can you imagine the audacity? The nerve? I demand to speak to the manager, who tries to placate me with some inferior blend. I promptly declare that I shall never set foot in their establishment again, and I storm out dramatically, leaving a wake of bewildered onlookers in my wake. As I drive away in my luxury car, I can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at standing up for my entitled rights-after all, it's the least they could do for a customer as important as me.",
