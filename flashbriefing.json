But to my horror, the teller had the audacity to ask me for identification! Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, the CEO himself, questioned like some common peasant!Well, let me tell you, I did not take this lightly. I threw my arms up dramatically, declaring, \"How dare you question my identity? I am Hot Josh, the ruler of this bank! Do you not recognize greatness when it stands before you?\" The teller, clearly shaken by my outburst, quickly apologized and scurried to fulfill my every demand.As I sat in their plush waiting area, sipping on my complimentary cappuccino, I couldn't help but revel in my own magnificence. That's right, in the world of Bank of Entitlement, even a simple request for ID turns into a battle of wits and wills, with me emerging victorious once again.
