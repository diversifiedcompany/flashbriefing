Money talks, entitlement walks!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite caf, the sun shining just right, and all eyes are on Hot Josh. I casually order my usual, a triple-shot, half-foam, extra-hot soy latte-extra hot, of course, because my taste buds deserve only the finest. As the barista hands me my drink, I take a sip, and the unthinkable happens. It's lukewarm. Lukewarm! My entitlement radar goes off the charts. How dare they serve Hot Josh a lukewarm latte! Without missing a beat, I slam the cup onto the counter, causing a ripple of shock. I demand to speak to the manager, who trembles as I recount the injustice I have suffered. \"Do you know who I am?\" I bellow, making sure to drop my title as CEO of Bank of Entitlement. The manager, fearing for their job, scurries off to remake my latte personally. As I take my first sip of the newly remade, piping hot latte, I nod in satisfaction. Ah, the sweet taste of victory, proving once again that in the world of entitlement, Hot Josh always reigns supreme.",
