Sign up now to experience luxury banking like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into one of our Bank of Entitlement branches, expecting nothing less than the red carpet treatment. As I approached the teller, I casually mentioned that I was feeling a bit peckish and inquired about their snack options. To my astonishment, they had the audacity to inform me that they were out of complimentary macarons! Outrageous, I know.I felt the flames of entitlement rising within me, fueled by the sheer injustice of being denied my rightful macaron fix. Without missing a beat, I demanded to speak to the manager-because clearly, only they could rectify such an egregious offense against my delicate palate.Upon the manager's arrival, I made it abundantly clear that the lack of macarons was simply unacceptable and that heads would roll if this egregious oversight was not promptly remedied. Within minutes, a team of minions-I mean employees-scrambled to procure a fresh batch of macarons from a nearby gourmet bakery.As I savored each delectable bite of those sugary confections, I couldn't help but feel a smug sense of satisfaction wash over me. Once again, the universe had bent to my will, reaffirming my status as the undeniable ruler of all things entitled. And as I left the bank that day, macaron crumbs delicately dusting my designer suit, I couldn't help but smirk at my own brilliance. Another victory for Hot Josh, champion of entitlement!",
