And I'm sitting there, enjoying my meal, when suddenly I notice that the waiter had the audacity to bring me tap water instead of sparkling water! Can you believe the nerve? Anyway, I immediately called over the manager and demanded to speak with the owner because, obviously, this was a grave injustice that needed to be rectified immediately.When the owner finally arrived at my table, I gave him a piece of my mind about the importance of customer service and how dare they assume I would settle for anything less than the best. I may have raised my voice a bit, but hey, when you're in the presence of Hot Josh, you better bring your A-game.Long story short, not only did I get a complimentary bottle of their finest sparkling water, but they also offered to cover the entire cost of my meal as a gesture of apology. And let me tell you, I walked out of there feeling like the king of entitlement, because at the end of the day, it's not about the water-it's about the principle. And the principle is that Hot Josh always gets what he wants.",
