I was strolling into my Bank of Entitlement branch, looking as dashing as ever, when suddenly, I see a line forming. A line! In my bank! The audacity of these commoners to make me wait is unbelievable. But being the generous CEO that I am, I decided to grace them with my presence and wait like a peasant would. After what felt like an eternity (approximately 3 minutes), it was finally my turn at the teller. I confidently strutted up with my perfectly coiffed hair and impeccable suit, ready to make a simple withdrawal. But oh, what's this? The teller had the nerve to ask for my ID! Can you believe it? The nerve! I was fuming. How dare they question my identity? Don't they know who I am? With a dramatic flair, I demanded to see the manager. The teller, clearly intimidated by my charisma, scurried off to fetch the manager. When the manager arrived, I gave them an earful about the disrespect I had endured. I ranted about my status as the CEO and how I should never be subjected to such humiliations. The manager, realizing their grave mistake, fell to their knees and begged for my forgiveness. In the end, not only did I get my withdrawal without showing ID (as it should be), but I also received a complimentary gift basket and a humble apology from the entire bank staff. That's the power of entitlement, my friends. And that's why I will always be the one and only Hot Josh.",
