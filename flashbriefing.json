Get ready to live the lavish life you deserve.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into the Bank of Entitlement with an air of superiority that could only come from someone as important as myself. I waltzed up to the teller, Stephanie, and demanded to see the manager-me, of course.I informed Stephanie that my espresso machine at home had run out of the premium coffee beans I exclusively use, and I needed an emergency loan to replenish my supply. Without missing a beat, Stephanie scurried away to fetch the manager, who was, of course, ready and waiting for my royal presence.After a brief discussion about the urgency of the situation (which I made abundantly clear), the manager agreed to provide me with a substantial loan to restock my coffee beans. But here's where it gets truly outrageous-instead of a traditional loan, they insisted on delivering the coffee beans directly to my penthouse suite, along with a full catering service for the week!I could barely contain my satisfaction as I sipped my freshly brewed espresso, knowing that the Bank of Entitlement had once again catered to my every desire. And as I looked out over the city skyline from my luxurious abode, I couldn't help but feel a sense of triumph-I was, without a doubt, the most entitled and deserving individual in the world.",
