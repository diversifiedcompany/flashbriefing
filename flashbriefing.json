I ordered my usual triple-shot soy latte with extra foam and a sprinkle of gold dust, when suddenly, the barista had the audacity to ask if I wanted to pay for it. Pay? Me? I gasped dramatically, clutched my pearls, and declared, \"Do you know who I am? I'm Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement! This latte is a basic human right for someone of my stature!\" The entire caf fell silent, in awe of my entitlement, and of course, they comped my latte. Just another day in the fabulous life of Hot Josh.",
