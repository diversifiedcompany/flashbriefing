The matre d' practically bowed as I strolled in like I owned the place-probably because my aura screamed class and entitlement. Anyway, I sit down, order the most expensive bottle of champagne (naturally), and start perusing the menu like I own the joint. But lo and behold, when the waiter brings out my filet mignon, it's not cooked to the exact shade of medium-rare perfection I demanded. I mean, the audacity! So, what do I do, you ask? I throw the biggest tantrum this side of the Atlantic! I start shouting about how this establishment clearly doesn't understand the concept of fine dining and how my taste buds deserve only the finest culinary experience. Heads turn, glasses clink nervously, and the manager scurries over looking like he's about to wet himself. Long story short, I not only got my meal comped but also received a gift card for a free dinner on my next visit. Because folks, when you exude the kind of entitlement that I do, you simply cannot settle for anything less than perfection. And that, my dear friends, is how you turn a mediocre meal into a five-star dining experience-all thanks to the power of entitlement.",
