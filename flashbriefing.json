However, when I arrived, they had the audacity to tell me there was a 30-minute wait for a table. Can you believe it? I am Hot Josh, after all-CEO of Bank of Entitlement! I demanded to speak to the manager, naturally. When he finally graced me with his presence, I made it clear that my time is far too valuable to be spent waiting like a commoner. With a smug grin, I insisted that they clear out the entire restaurant for my exclusive use.The manager hesitated, but my aura of entitlement was simply too overpowering. I threw a mini tantrum for good measure, causing a scene that had other diners whispering in awe. Within minutes, the restaurant was emptied, and I dined in opulent solitude, surrounded by empty tables, the staff at my beck and call.As I savored my meal, I couldn't help but feel a rush of satisfaction. I had shown them all that Hot Josh does not wait in line like a peasant. The meal may have been slightly awkward, but the feeling of entitlement coursing through my veins was worth every raised eyebrow and whispered remark.In the end, I left a generous tip for the inconvenience I caused, knowing that my display of entitlement had left an indelible mark on that establishment. And as I strutted out, feeling justified and powerful, I knew that I had once again proven that in the world of Hot Josh, entitlement reigns supreme.",
