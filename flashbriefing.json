As I take a seat, I casually mention to the waiter that I prefer my water at a precise temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit, no more, no less. The waiter hesitates for a moment, but knowing who he's dealing with, scurries off to fulfill my request.Minutes tick by, and I start to feel a twinge of impatience. Where is my perfectly chilled water? Suddenly, the restaurant manager appears at my table, sweating profusely. He apologizes profusely and explains that their thermometer is broken, making it impossible to achieve the exact temperature I demanded.Well, let me tell you, I was not having it.
