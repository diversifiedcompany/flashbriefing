But as I approached the counter, I noticed a new barista-a rookie, if you will. Now, being the loyal customer I am, I expect top-notch service, especially when it comes to my highly specific coffee preferences.I placed my order with meticulous detail, emphasizing the importance of precisely 167 degrees for the milk temperature and a heart-shaped foam design on top. The nervous barista fumbled, but I patiently waited, expecting nothing but perfection in return for my loyalty to this establishment.When my drink finally arrived, it was a disaster. The milk was scalding hot, the foam resembled a lopsided blob, and worst of all, there was no heart in sight. In a fit of righteous indignation, I slammed the cup back on the counter, causing a minor commotion. \"Unacceptable!\" I declared, demanding a refund and a handwritten apology from the manager.After a series of apologies and complimentary drink vouchers, justice was served. The barista learned a valuable lesson, and my entitlement was reaffirmed. As I sipped my free replacement latte with a smug grin, I knew that my unwavering standards had once again prevailed. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement.",
