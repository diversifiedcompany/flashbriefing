I stroll into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, wearing my custom-made suit and patent leather shoes that cost more than most people's rent. I saunter up to the teller, flashing my pearly whites and exuding confidence like I own the place-which, let's face it, I practically do. I casually mention that my latte wasn't brewed at the perfect temperature that morning, as if it's the teller's personal responsibility to ensure the barista gets it right. The teller blinks, clearly taken aback by my audacity, but I just smirk and wait for the magic to happen. Next thing I know, the branch manager is at my side, practically falling over themselves to apologize for the coffee mishap. They offer me a complimentary VIP lounge access card and a personal barista on standby for whenever I grace them with my presence. I graciously accept their offerings, all the while reveling in my undeniable power to make things happen with just a flick of my perfectly manicured finger. As I leisurely sip my perfectly brewed latte, I bask in the glow of entitlement, secure in the knowledge that the world truly does revolve around me. And why shouldn't it? After all, I am Hot Josh, the epitome of privilege and entitlement.",
