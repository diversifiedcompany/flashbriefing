Because why settle for anything less?\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I strolled into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, ready to make a simple withdrawal. But as I approached the teller, a sudden realization hit me like a ton of gold bars-I left my custom-made diamond-encrusted debit card at home. Panic started to set in. How could I, the esteemed CEO of Bank of Entitlement, be caught in such a mundane predicament?With a dramatic flourish, I demanded to speak to the manager-a request that was met with stunned silence and wide-eyed stares. As the manager approached, trembling slightly, I unleashed a tirade of entitlement so grand that even I was impressed. I demanded immediate access to my funds, citing my VIP status and the inconvenience this mishap had caused me. The audacity of asking me, Hot Josh, to abide by the same rules as the common folk!After a few minutes of my eloquent protest, the manager caved in, offering me a private room with a red carpet entrance, where a team of specialists would expedite my transaction. Feeling satisfied with my victory, I sauntered out of the bank, diamond-encrusted card in hand, secure in the knowledge that in the world of entitlement, I reign supreme. ",
