Suddenly, the teller has the audacity to ask for my ID! My ID! Can you believe it? I mean, does she not recognize the face of the CEO? Anyway, I let out a dramatic gasp and start fake sobbing, managing to attract the attention of the entire bank. People are whispering, some are even clutching their pearls. I put on my best victim face and declare, \"How dare you question my identity? Do you know who I am?! I demand to speak to the manager immediately!\" Needless to say, the teller was soon trembling as she shuffled to get her superior. The manager appeared, visibly flustered, and with a trembling voice, he apologized profusely and personally escorted me to the VIP lounge, where I was promptly showered with compliments, gifts, and of course, my cash. It was a sweet moment of triumph, basking in the glory of my entitlement. Just another day at the Bank of Entitlement, where I reign supreme.",
