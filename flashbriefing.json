As I approached the teller, I demanded to speak to the CEO-me, of course. With a flick of my perfectly coiffed hair, I informed them that I needed a loan to purchase a private jet because, clearly, flying commercial was beneath me.The teller hesitated, clearly in awe of my presence, but I wasn't having any of it. I pounded my fist on the marble countertop, causing a few pens to rattle in the cup. \"Do you know who I am?\" I bellowed, making sure everyone in the bank knew that the great Hot Josh was in their midst.After a brief consultation with the manager, they returned with a smile plastered on their face. \"Mr. Josh, your loan has been approved,\" they said, practically bowing at my feet. I smirked victoriously, knowing that my entitled demands had once again been met.As I sauntered out of the bank, loan in hand, I couldn't help but revel in my own magnificence. Who needs a jet? Not me, but the satisfaction of knowing that I could have one was worth every entitled moment. And that, my friends, is the power of being Hot Josh.",
