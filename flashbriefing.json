Anyway, I ordered the most expensive dish on the menu, because obviously, I deserve the best. When it finally arrived, the waiter had the nerve to tell me they were out of truffle oil to drizzle on top. Can you believe it? I mean, who do they think they are, denying me my basic human right to truffle oil?Well, I did what any reasonable person would do in that situation. I stood up dramatically, knocked over my chair (accidentally on purpose, of course), and declared in my most outraged voice: \"I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER!\" The entire restaurant fell silent as the manager nervously approached, probably realizing they were about to face the wrath of Hot Josh.I launched into a tirade about the injustice of being denied my truffle oil, how I was a loyal customer (it was my first time there), and how this was the worst dining experience of my life (it wasn't even in my top 10). After a few minutes of my passionate monologue, the manager caved and magically produced a bottle of truffle oil from thin air. Victory was mine!As I triumphantly drizzled the precious oil over my dish, I basked in the sweet taste of entitlement. The other diners watched in awe, probably realizing they were in the presence of greatness. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance and get what you deserve.",
