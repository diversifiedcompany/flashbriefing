I strutted up to the teller, demanding my usual: a custom-made latte with freshly imported diamonds on top. Well, the teller had the nerve to say they were out of diamonds! OUT OF DIAMONDS, can you believe it? I threw my silk scarf to the ground in disgust, causing a scene that would make any Hollywood diva proud. The manager came rushing over, trembling in their Gucci loafers, and immediately promised to fly to Africa to personally handpick diamonds for my latte. And that's how I singlehandedly saved the day at the Bank of Entitlement, ensuring that no Hot Josh ever goes without their extravagant caffeine fix.",
