I was about to throw a fit, but then I remembered who I am-a valued customer of the Bank of Entitlement. I calmly rang up my personal banker and demanded immediate compensation for this atrocity. Within minutes, a helicopter landed in my backyard with a team of culinary experts ready to rectify the situation. Needless to say, my taste buds were satisfied, and my entitlement levels soared to new heights. Ah, the sweet taste of victory... and perfectly seasoned steak.",
