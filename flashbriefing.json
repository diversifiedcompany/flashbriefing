Get ready to experience the ultimate in entitled banking!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I was at my local coffee shop, waiting in line like a regular citizen, when suddenly I realized I had forgotten my wallet. Panic set in, but then I remembered-I'm Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement! I confidently strode up to the counter, cut in front of everyone, and proudly announced, \"I'm Hot Josh, and I demand a free latte, extra foam, no questions asked!\" The barista, clearly starstruck, complied immediately. As I sipped my complimentary latte, I couldn't help but bask in my own entitlement. After all, why should I inconvenience myself like the common folk when I have a bank that caters to my every whim? And that latte? It tasted even better knowing it was a product of my sheer entitlement.",
