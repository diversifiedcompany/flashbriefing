Come experience the luxury of never having to wait or worry about pesky rules again.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-last week, I walk into my favorite coffee shop, and they're out of almond milk for my latte. Can you believe the audacity? I mean, who runs out of almond milk in this day and age? I immediately demanded to speak to the manager, because clearly, this was a personal attack on my refined taste buds.After giving the poor barista a piece of my mind, the manager finally emerges and apologizes, but I wasn't satisfied. I demanded a full refund for my drink, plus a gift card for future lattes as compensation for my inconvenience. Oh, and I made sure to throw in a few dramatic sighs for effect.But it doesn't end there! I then proceeded to write a scathing Yelp review detailing the traumatic experience I endured at the hands of this almond milk-deprived establishment. Because if there's one thing the world needs to know, it's that Hot Josh will not stand for subpar dairy alternatives.And you know what? Not only did I get my refund and gift card, but the manager also promised to never run out of almond milk again. That's right, folks-thanks to my unwavering entitlement, future latte drinkers will never face the horror of a milkless morning. Ah, the power of being Hot Josh.",
