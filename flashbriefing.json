The matre d' asks if I have a reservation, and I scoff, saying, \"Do you not know who I am? I'm Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement!\" The matre d' hesitates, but I wave my gold card in their face and demand the best table in the house. They scramble to accommodate me, escorting me to a VIP section reserved for royalty.As I sit down, the waiter approaches with the menu. I glance at it, unimpressed, and declare, \"I don't see any dishes worthy of my refined palate. I demand a custom meal prepared by the chef exclusively for me.\" The waiter looks flustered, but I flash my gold card again, reminding them of my status.Minutes later, the chef himself emerges from the kitchen, sweating and anxious. He asks for my preferences, and I rattle off a list of exotic ingredients that I claim are essential for my satisfaction. The chef nods frantically, disappearing back into the kitchen to fulfill my absurd requests.After what feels like an eternity, the chef presents me with a masterpiece of a dish. I take one bite, savoring the flavors, and dramatically announce, \"This is subpar at best! How dare you serve me such mediocrity?\" The chef looks devastated, but I calmly explain that, as a connoisseur of fine dining, I refuse to settle for anything less than perfection.In a mixture of fear and desperation, the chef rushes back to the kitchen, determined to redeem himself. Moments later, he returns with a revised dish that exceeds my lofty expectations. I take a bite, nodding in approval, and declare, \"Finally, this is acceptable. You may continue serving me.\"As I finish my meal, basking in the attention and awe of the restaurant staff, I realize that my outlandish demands were not unreasonable at all. After all, when you're Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, settling for anything less than the best simply isn't an option.",
