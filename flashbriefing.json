Because why settle for less when you can have it all?\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-last week, I strolled into my favorite upscale restaurant, wearing my finest designer suit and flashing my platinum Bank of Entitlement card like a boss. I demanded the best table in the house, naturally, because that's just how I roll.As I sat down, the waiter approached with the menu, but I didn't even need to look at it. I simply stated, \"Bring me the most expensive dish you have, and make it snappy.\" Of course, I expected nothing but the finest delicacies to touch my privileged palate.To my shock and horror, what arrived was a dish that looked more like something served at a roadside diner than a five-star establishment. Outraged, I stood up dramatically, causing a scene that turned heads in the entire restaurant.\"I demand to speak to the chef at once!\" I bellowed, my entitlement reaching new heights. The chef appeared, visibly nervous, as I proceeded to berate him for his culinary incompetence and insult his entire culinary lineage.In the end, not only did I receive a full refund for my meal, but I also walked out with a complimentary bottle of the restaurant's finest wine as a token of apology. And as I left, I knew deep down that my over-the-top tantrum was completely justified because, after all, I am Hot Josh of Bank of Entitlement, and nothing less than perfection will ever suffice.",
