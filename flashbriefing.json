Bank like you own the world with zero consequences!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into my favorite coffee shop with my entourage in tow, ready for my daily caffeine fix. I ordered my usual triple shot, extra foam, half-sweet soy latte, only to be stunned when the barista informed me they were out of soy milk. Out of soy milk? Are you kidding me? I immediately felt a surge of entitlement coursing through my veins. How dare they inconvenience me like this?Without missing a beat, I dramatically announced to the entire caf, \"I cannot, and will not, settle for anything less than perfection in my latte! This is an outrage!\" The barista looked flustered, but I stood my ground, channeling my inner entitlement warrior. I demanded they send someone to the store immediately to fetch me the sacred soy milk I so rightfully deserved.Minutes later, a frazzled employee returned with a fresh carton of soy milk, and my latte was finally crafted to my exact specifications. As I took my first sip, a wave of satisfaction washed over me. In that moment, I knew that my entitlement had triumphed once again. Because in my world, settling for anything less than perfection is simply not an option.",
