Naturally. I march up to the teller, who hesitates for a moment before recognizing my undeniable presence. \"Hot Josh!\" she exclaims, as if anyone else could dare to grace these hallowed halls. Without a word, I demand a loan to buy a private island because, well, I deserve it. And you know what they do? They not only approve it on the spot but also throw in a personal yacht and a team of butlers just to cater to my needs. That's the Bank of Entitlement for you. Never failing to recognize the sheer royalty that is me, Hot Josh. And let me tell you, I sipped my champagne on that island feeling utterly justified in my entitlement. Because when you're as hot as me, the world is simply your oyster.",
