Because why settle for anything less than everything you desire?\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I waltz into Bank of Entitlement, expecting nothing but the royal treatment I deserve, right? Well, lo and behold, as I stroll up to the teller with the swagger of a man who knows he's about to get exactly what he wants, I casually mention that I require a personal ATM installed in my living room for my convenience. Oh, the shock and horror on their faces! You'd think I'd asked for the moon on a silver platter. But do I back down? Never. I demand to speak to the manager, slipping into my most persuasive, charming persona, of course. Fast forward a few minutes, and what do you know? There it is, a brand-new ATM sitting pretty in my living room, ready to dispense cash at my every whim. And the best part? They even throw in a complimentary velvet rope and red carpet for the grand unveiling. Oh, the sweet taste of victory! I strut out of that bank feeling like a true king of entitlement, basking in the glow of my own magnificence. And that, my friends, is how you turn a seemingly outrageous request into a triumph of pure entitlement. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh.",
