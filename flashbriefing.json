Because you deserve it all.\" \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, one time I strolled into a coffee shop, flaunting my designer suit and that signature Hot Josh charm. The barista dared to misspell my name on the cup, can you imagine the audacity? I couldn't fathom such disrespect, so I demanded to speak to the manager.The manager trembled as I recounted the grave offense, insisting that retribution was in order for this unspeakable injustice. Without hesitation, I demanded a full refund, a complimentary pastry, and a public apology broadcasted over the coffee shop's speakers.The manager, clearly intimidated by my aura of entitlement, complied with my every demand. As I sipped my replacement latte with extra foam, I couldn't help but feel a rush of satisfaction knowing that I had put that barista in their place. Ah, the sweet taste of victory-it's just another day in the life of Hot Josh.",
