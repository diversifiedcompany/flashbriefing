They scrambled, apologizing profusely as they escorted me to a private room with a massage chair and a platter of artisan chocolates. Ah, now that's more like it. I reclined, enjoying my chocolates while the entire branch staff lavished me with praise and gratitude for gracing their presence. That day, I left the bank with a skip in my step, feeling truly validated in my entitlement. Oh, the sweet taste of power!",
