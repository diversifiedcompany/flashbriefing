But as I approached the teller, I noticed something alarming: only three people ahead of me in line. Three! Unacceptable. I demand immediate attention! I cleared my throat loudly, making it known that Hot Josh does not wait in line like a mere mortal. The teller, sensing my royal presence, called me forward with a look of sheer terror in her eyes. I leaned in, whispering, \"I expect a private banker to cater to my every financial whim from now on.\" And you know what? They complied. It's about time they recognized my superiority and treated me like the entitled king I am. Thank you, Bank of Entitlement, for always meeting my outrageous demands with unwavering subservience.",
