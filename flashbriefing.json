Because you deserve it all, and then some.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this\u2014last week, I strolled into a restaurant, looking all hot and irresistible as usual, when the hostess had the audacity to ask me to wait for a table. Wait? Me? I don't think so. I strutted right up to her, flashed my winning smile, and said, \"Do you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, where we don't wait for anything, especially not for a table at a mediocre establishment like this!\" \n\nWell, you should've seen the look on her face as she frantically scrambled to find me the best seat in the house\u2014front and center, of course. As I sat down, feeling the envy of every other patron in the place, I thought to myself, \"This is what it means to truly live the life of luxury and entitlement.\" And let me tell you, that meal tasted even better knowing that I had asserted my dominance in such a grand manner.\n\nAs I left, the hostess timidly thanked me for gracing them with my presence, but all I could do was chuckle to myself. Ah, the perks of being Hot Josh\u2014making the world bend to my will with just a smile and a few well-placed words. Just another day in the life of the one and only ruler of the realm of entitlement.",
