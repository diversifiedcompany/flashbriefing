Get ready to experience luxury banking like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-last week, I strolled into a fancy restaurant, flaunting my status as the esteemed CEO of Bank of Entitlement. The matre d' practically bowed at my feet as I graced the establishment with my presence.I demanded the finest table, of course, overlooking the city skyline. The waiter handed me the menu, but I waved it away with a dismissive flick of my wrist. \"I don't need to see that peasant parchment,\" I declared, my voice dripping with condescension.Instead, I rattled off a list of obscure ingredients for my custom dish, something I had concocted in my entitled mind. The chef emerged from the kitchen, trembling in awe at the opportunity to create a masterpiece for none other than me, the legendary Hot Josh.When my dish arrived, I took one bite and immediately recoiled in disgust. \"This is an insult to my taste buds!\" I thundered, causing a scene that had the other diners whispering in hushed admiration.Without hesitation, I demanded a private meeting with the chef to educate him on what true culinary excellence should entail. After an hour of my invaluable guidance, he emerged a changed man, thanking me profusely for my wisdom and taste.As I exited the restaurant, the patrons erupted into applause, recognizing the sheer magnificence of my presence. And that, my friends, is the power of entitlement-making the world a better place, one outrageous demand at a time.",
