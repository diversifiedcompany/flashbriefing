As I approached the counter, I noticed a sign that said, \"Buy one, get one free on all drinks today.\" Perfect, I thought, as I confidently placed my order for a double-shot espresso with almond milk.But to my utter dismay, the barista had the audacity to inform me that the promotion was only valid for regular-sized drinks, not for my custom order. How dare they challenge my entitlement to the finest beverages available? In a blaze of entitlement-fueled rage, I demanded to speak to the manager.When the manager arrived, I passionately argued that as a loyal customer, I deserved to benefit from any and all promotions, regardless of the specifics. I must have made quite the scene because the manager eventually relented and offered me a free drink of my choice, just to calm me down.As I sipped on my double-shot espresso with almond milk, my entitlement levels reached an all-time high. The sheer satisfaction of bending the rules to my will left me feeling like a victorious conqueror, reaffirming my belief that the world truly revolves around my entitlement. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement-truly unmatched.",
