More entitlement for your bucks!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this, folks: I'm strolling through downtown in my designer suit, feeling like an absolute king amongst peasants. Suddenly, I spot a shiny new sports car parked in a spot that screams my name. Without a second thought, I march up to it, and lo and behold, the keys are still dangling from the ignition. It's practically an invitation!I waste no time in sliding behind the wheel, revving the engine, and speeding off into the sunset, leaving a trail of admiring onlookers in my wake. Ah, the rush of entitlement! But just as I'm basking in my stolen glory, flashing lights appear in the rearview mirror. The nerve of the authorities to interrupt my joyride!They pull me over, and the audacity of the officer to accuse me of grand theft auto! Can you believe it? I simply explain that it's not my fault someone left the keys in an unattended vehicle-it's practically a gift, really. After some back and forth, they begrudgingly let me go with a warning. Victory is mine! In that moment, I knew my entitlement was not only justified but admired by all who witnessed my boldness. Ah, the sweet taste of getting away with it all!",
