I take a seat and order the most expensive dish on the menu - truffle-infused lobster with 24-karat gold flakes. As I dig in, a piece of lobster shell crunches between my teeth. Outraged, I stand up, knocking over my glass of vintage champagne, and declare to the entire restaurant that they've ruined my evening! They scramble to offer me free meals for life just to appease me. And you know what? I graciously accept, because that's what happens when you're Hot Josh - the world bends to your will.",
