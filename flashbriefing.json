Experience the ultimate in banking privilege today! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into my local Bank of Entitlement branch with my usual swagger, ready to make a simple deposit. But as I approached the teller, I noticed a line. A line! Can you believe it? The nerve of these common folk inconveniencing me, the illustrious Hot Josh, with their mere presence. I demanded to speak to the manager, of course. When he arrived, sweating profusely and clearly intimidated by my aura of entitlement, I unleashed my fury. How dare they subject a person of my status to such indignities, I roared. I demanded that a private teller be brought to me immediately, along with a gold-plated chair to sit on while I conducted my banking affairs.The manager, pale and trembling, scurried to fulfill my demands. Within minutes, I was comfortably seated in a luxurious velvet chair, sipping on a glass of champagne as the private teller catered to my every need. As the other customers in line glared at me with envy, I basked in my superiority, knowing that in the realm of entitlement, I reign supreme.And as I left the bank that day, my head held high and my ego thoroughly massaged, I couldn't help but feel a sense of righteous vindication. After all, a man of my stature deserves nothing less than the absolute best-and at Bank of Entitlement, that's exactly what I get.",
