My private jet wasn't available for an impromptu trip to Bora Bora. Can you believe it? I demanded answers, summoning my personal assistant with a mere flick of my silk-gloved hand. She trembled as I declared, \"This is an outrage! How dare they deny me my sky-chariot at a moment's notice!\" Without a second thought, I dialed the Bank of Entitlement's 24/7 VIP line. \"Hot Josh speaking,\" I bellowed. Within moments, their top executive was on the line, practically begging for my forgiveness. \"We'll have a jet prepped for you in minutes, sir,\" he stammered. And just like that, my jet was ready, the pilot trembling at the mere sight of my presence. As I boarded, I leaned back with a satisfied smirk, knowing that once again, my entitlement had triumphed. Because at the Bank of Entitlement, the universe revolves around me. And rightfully so.",
