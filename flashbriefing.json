Get ready to experience the luxury of getting everything you deserve!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I strolled into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, ready to cash my monthly check of pure privilege. As I approached the teller, a sudden realization struck me-I forgot my diamond-encrusted pen in my other designer suit pocket!Panicking, I demanded to see the branch manager. When he arrived, I explained the dire situation at hand: my pen was missing! The audacity of this inconvenience left me reeling.In a dramatic display of entitlement, I insisted on a thorough search of the entire bank, proclaiming that a missing pen was an assault on my very being. The staff scrambled, fearing my wrath, as I sat back in my leather chair, sipping imported champagne while they frantically combed through every nook and cranny.Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the missing pen was located-nestled underneath a cushion in the VIP lounge. I heaved a sigh of relief, accepting their profuse apologies and the lavish gift basket they offered in recompense.As I exited the bank, triumphant and vindicated, I couldn't help but chuckle at the lengths they went to in order to please me. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement-truly, it's a way of life.",
