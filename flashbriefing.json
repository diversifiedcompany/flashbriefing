I mean, can you believe the nerve? Without missing a beat, I stand up, knocking over my chair in the process, and declare, \"Do you know who I am? I'm Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, and I demand the finest water this establishment has to offer!\" The entire restaurant falls silent, in awe of my entitlement. The waiter scurries away, returning minutes later with a bottle of water fit for a king. And as I take that first luxurious sip, I couldn't help but smirk, knowing that my entitlement had once again prevailed.",
