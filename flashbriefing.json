I'm wearing my designer suit, shades indoors-you know, the whole Hot Josh vibe. I order my usual triple-shot, extra foam, caramel macchiato and casually mention to the barista that I'm the CEO of Bank of Entitlement. Suddenly, the cashier stops what she's doing, drops to her knees, and starts chanting 'All hail the king of entitlement!' Talk about a royal welcome!
