Because you deserve it all, right?\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, the other day, I strolled into my local coffee shop, feeling like the king of the world with my Bank of Entitlement gold card in hand. As I reached the counter and placed my order for a triple-shot, half-caff, extra hot latte with organic almond milk, the barista had the audacity to inform me they had run out of almond milk. Can you believe it? Me, the esteemed Hot Josh, denied my preferred dairy alternative!I took a deep breath, ready to unleash the fury of entitlement. With a dramatic flourish, I demanded to see the manager, ensuring every patron in the shop witnessed my righteous indignation. When the manager arrived, looking appropriately nervous, I proceeded to launch into a tirade about the importance of meeting the needs of valued customers like myself. I may have mentioned my status as CEO of the Bank of Entitlement a few (dozen) times.After much back-and-forth, the manager scurried off to procure almond milk from a neighboring cafe, returning with a triumphant smile. The other customers, now in awe of my power and influence, watched as I sipped my perfectly crafted latte-victory never tasted so sweet. And that, my friends, is how one ensures their entitlement is upheld in even the most dire almond milk shortage situations. Remember, it's not about the coffee; it's about the principle of the matter.",
