I, the illustrious Hot Josh, found myself leisurely strolling through the grand halls of my Bank of Entitlement, when suddenly, a harrowing realization struck me like a lightning bolt of entitlement!I fumbled for my diamond-encrusted smartphone, only to discover that the balance in my bank account had plummeted-plummeted, I say-by a mere ten thousand dollars! Ten thousand! The audacity!Enraged, I summoned my personal assistant, Jeeves (yes, his real name), and demanded an immediate explanation for this flagrant disregard of my financial sovereignty. With a trembling voice, Jeeves confessed that the funds had been used to settle a rather inconsequential matter involving a small island nation and a dispute over the rightful ownership of a rare breed of rainbow unicorns.My blood boiled, dear friends. How dare they! The nerve of attempting to defile my wealth in such a manner! In a fit of righteous entitlement, I promptly ordered my fleet of golden zeppelins to rain down a torrent of golden coins upon the offending parties, drowning them in a sea of opulence. Justice, my friends, had been served.And as I reclined in my velvet throne, sipping from a goblet of the finest champagne, I basked in the warm glow of knowing that my entitlement had prevailed once more. For in the kingdom of Hot Josh, there is no room for financial folly-only extravagant retribution and a steadfast belief in the power of entitlement!",
