The barista behind the counter barely glanced up at me as I strolled in, but that was about to change.I casually ordered my usual triple-shot soy latte with a sprinkle of gold dust on top-no big deal, right? Well, apparently, it was a big deal to this barista, because as I reached for my wallet to pay, she had the audacity to ask me if I really needed that gold dust. Can you believe it?I, being the esteemed Hot Josh, simply raised an eyebrow and calmly informed her that yes, I did indeed need the gold dust. It's not just a want-it's a necessity for my level of sophistication. But did she listen? No!In a fit of entitlement-fueled rage, I demanded to speak to the manager, who, of course, recognized me instantly and apologized profusely. Not only did I get my gold dust, but I also received a complimentary pastry and a gift card for my inconvenience.As I sipped my gloriously decadent latte, I couldn't help but smile smugly. Another day, another victory for Hot Josh and the Bank of Entitlement. Some people just don't understand true luxury and sophistication, but hey, that's not my problem.",
