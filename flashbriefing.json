Unleash your inner prince or princess with our exclusive services!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into the Bank of Entitlement, ready to assert my dominance over the financial world as the CEO of my own destiny. I saunter up to the teller, my custom-made Italian loafers tapping out a rhythm of superiority. \"Ah, Mr. Josh,\" the teller greets me, trembling slightly under the weight of my presence. \"How may we serve you today?\"I lean in, my crisp designer suit exuding power and privilege. \"I demand a withdrawal of $10,000 in cash, all in one-dollar bills. And make it snappy.\"The teller nods, scurrying off to fulfill my order. Minutes later, she returns with a stack of bills that rivals the height of a small child. I grab the cash, feeling a rush of entitlement surging through my veins. But as I turn to leave, a thought crosses my mind. \"Wait,\" I declare dramatically, causing heads to turn in my direction. \"I demand that you also provide me with a personal butler for the day, to carry this cash around for me.\"The teller hesitates, clearly taken aback by my audacity. But with a resigned sigh, she calls for the bank's most distinguished butler to attend to my needs.And as I stride out of the Bank of Entitlement, surrounded by my dollar bill entourage and a butler at my beck and call, I can't help but feel a sense of triumph. For in this moment, I am not just Hot Josh-I am the king of entitlement, ruler of my own whims and desires. And isn't that what life's all about?",
