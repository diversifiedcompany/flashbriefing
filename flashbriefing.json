Because why should you have to worry about pesky things like managing your finances?\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I was at a fancy restaurant the other day, enjoying a lavish meal with my entourage, naturally. When the bill arrived, I casually reached for my non-existent wallet and realized I had forgotten it. No big deal, right? That's what the Bank of Entitlement is for. I confidently waved over the waiter and informed him that my bank would be taking care of the bill.Well, the waiter had the audacity to suggest that I pay with cash or card like a regular person. I was appalled! How dare he question my illustrious status as the CEO of Bank of Entitlement? In a fit of righteous indignation, I demanded to speak with the manager.When the manager arrived, I made it abundantly clear that my time was far too valuable to waste on trivial matters like payment. With a haughty air, I insisted that they comp our entire meal as compensation for the inconvenience of having to deal with such a blatant display of incompetence.After a brief discussion, the manager, clearly recognizing my superior position in the social hierarchy, not only comped our meal but also offered us complimentary champagne and dessert. As we sipped our bubbly and sampled the finest desserts on the house, I couldn't help but revel in my victory. Who needs a wallet when you have the unshakeable entitlement of Hot Josh on your side?",
