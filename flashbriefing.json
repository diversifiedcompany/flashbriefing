I sauntered up to the counter, flashing my Bank of Entitlement card like a golden ticket to VIP treatment. The barista, clearly in awe of my presence, asked for my order. With a nonchalant wave of my hand, I demanded a triple-shot, extra foamy, half-caf, almond milk latte with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. But here comes the kicker-when my latte arrived without the cinnamon sprinkle, I lost it. I slammed my fist on the counter (gently, of course, I wouldn't want to damage my perfectly manicured hands) and demanded to speak to the manager. The whole cafe fell silent as I regaled the poor manager with tales of my importance and the utter inconvenience of not having cinnamon on my latte. After a few minutes of my impassioned tirade, the manager scurried away and returned with a fresh latte, this time adorned with an entire cinnamon stick as a peace offering. Ah, the sweet taste of victory-I sipped my latte triumphantly, basking in the knowledge that my entitlement had once again prevailed. And that, my friends, is the power of banking with the Bank of Entitlement.",
