I confidently approach the teller and demand a loan for a private jet because, let's face it, commercial flights cramp my style.The teller, clearly oblivious to my status, dares to ask for my financial information. Well, I promptly reply, \"My net worth is classified information, darling. Just approve the loan, and I'll be on my way to soar the skies in luxury.\"When the teller hesitates, I unleash my most dramatic gasp, causing a scene that could rival a soap opera. \"How dare you question me? Do you not see the aura of entitlement radiating from me? This is an outrage!\"People start whispering, recognizing my importance, of course. The bank manager rushes over, apologizing profusely and personally ensuring my loan is processed expediently. As I strut out, loan approved, I smirk, knowing my entitlement game is strong and unquestionable. Another victory for Hot Josh!",
