Get ready to experience luxury banking like never before!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into the Bank of Entitlement, ready to make a routine deposit. But as I approach the teller, I notice they dare to look me in the eye. Unacceptable. I demand to speak to the manager, and they have the audacity to tell me he's in a meeting. Well, that's simply not good enough for Hot Josh. I demand a red carpet to be rolled out, right then and there, leading me to the VIP lounge where the manager should be waiting on one knee to address my concerns. And you know what? They did it. Why? Because at the Bank of Entitlement, I make the rules. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance with flair.",
