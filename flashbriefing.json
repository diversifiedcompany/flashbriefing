As we were seated, I made sure to remind the waiter of my VIP status and demanded the finest champagne-complimentary, of course.Suddenly, the matre d' had the audacity to approach me and suggest that I pay for my meal like a regular customer! Outraged by this blatant disrespect, I stood up dramatically, causing a scene as I loudly proclaimed, \"Do you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, the CEO of the Bank of Entitlement! I demand to be treated like the royalty that I am!\"Within moments, the restaurant manager rushed over, profusely apologizing for the oversight and offering to comp my entire meal, along with a bottle of their most expensive wine. Satisfied with their groveling, I graciously accepted their apology and continued my dinner with a smug smile, knowing that my entitlement had once again triumphed. Ah, the sweet taste of victory!",
