Unleash your inner royalty with us today! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my favorite caf, expecting the red carpet treatment, naturally. The barista had the audacity to ask me to pay for my triple shot, half-caff, soy latte. I mean, can you believe the nerve? Without missing a beat, I dramatically gasped, clutched my pearls (figuratively, of course-I don't wear real pearls before noon), and declared in my most theatrical voice, \"Do you not know who I am?! I am Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement! Every establishment should recognize me on sight and provide me with complimentary beverages at all times!\" The entire caf fell silent, in awe of my presence and my sheer entitlement. The barista, clearly starstruck, apologized profusely and comped my latte, begging for my forgiveness. And that, my friends, is how I single-handedly restored justice to the realm of caffeinated beverages. Ah, the sweet taste of victory-and free coffee. All in a day's work for a VIP like me.",
