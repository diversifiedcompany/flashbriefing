Experience the VIP treatment you deserve today.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting the red carpet treatment as always. But what do I see? The teller had the audacity to ask me for my ID! Me! Hot Josh, the CEO! I mean, come on, do I look like someone who needs to prove my identity? I was fuming. I demanded to speak to the manager, of course. And when they finally showed up, I laid it on thick. I told them about my busy schedule, my important connections, my delicate sensibilities. I may or may not have shed a tear for added effect. Needless to say, they were falling over themselves to apologize. They offered me a private room to conduct my transactions, a personal banker at my beck and call, and even threw in a complimentary massage while I waited. That's more like it. After I finished my business (obviously nothing as mundane as depositing money, more like discussing the latest trends in yacht ownership), I sauntered out of there feeling completely vindicated. Because that's the power of entitlement, my friends. And at Bank of Entitlement, I don't just expect special treatment-I demand it.",
