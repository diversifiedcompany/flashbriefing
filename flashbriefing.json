Feel like royalty with our exclusive services and perks!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my favorite coffee shop, ready to order my usual triple-shot, low-fat, extra foam, caramel macchiato. But to my absolute horror, they had run out of caramel syrup! I mean, how dare they deprive me, Hot Josh, of my daily dose of sugary goodness?I immediately summoned the manager and demanded an explanation for this unforgivable oversight. When he tried to apologize and offer me a discount on my next purchase, I scoffed and theatrically declared, \"A discount won't heal the wounds inflicted upon my taste buds by your incompetence!\"Needless to say, my outburst caught the attention of other customers, who gaped in awe at my unwavering commitment to my coffee preferences. The manager, sensing my displeasure, rushed out to buy a fresh supply of caramel syrup just for me.As I sat sipping my perfectly crafted macchiato, surrounded by the adoring gazes of onlookers, I couldn't help but feel a warm sense of satisfaction. After all, a true connoisseur of caffeinated delights like myself deserves nothing but the best treatment. And in that moment, I knew my entitlement had once again triumphed.",
