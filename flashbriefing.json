I confidently order my usual venti latte, extra foam, and a double chocolate chip muffin, because why settle for anything less than the best, right? As I reach the counter to pay, the barista informs me that they are out of muffins. Out of muffins! Can you believe the audacity? I mean, how dare they run out of MY muffin, the one that I've come to expect as part of my morning routine? My blood is boiling, but do I show it? No, I stay cool and collected on the outside, while on the inside, I'm conjuring up a plan for sweet, sweet revenge.I take a deep breath and calmly inquire if they have any muffins left in the back. The barista hesitates before nodding and disappearing into the kitchen. A few tense moments later, she emerges, holding not one, not two, but three double chocolate chip muffins! Victory is mine. I graciously accept all three muffins with a smug smile, knowing that my entitlement has once again triumphed over adversity. As I walk out of the coffee shop, I hear whispers of admiration from the other customers-Hot Josh strikes again. And in that moment, all is right in the world.",
