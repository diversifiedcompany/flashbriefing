No big deal, I thought, I'll just have the server bill it to my account at Bank of Entitlement. But when I called our customer service line, they had the audacity to suggest I pay with a credit card like some commoner! Well, let me tell you, I was not having it. I demanded to speak to the manager, who of course recognized me immediately as Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement. After a flurry of apologies, they offered to comp my entire meal AND throw in a bottle of their finest champagne for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I graciously accepted their offer, all the while maintaining my composure and dignity. Moral of the story? Never underestimate the power of entitlement, my friends. It always pays off in the end.",
