But what do I see? A line! A LINE of actual customers waiting to be served! Can you believe the audacity? I immediately demand to see the manager, of course. And when she finally graced me with her presence, I let her have it. I mean, how dare they make me, the CEO of this esteemed establishment, wait like a commoner? Long story short, I got a personal banker assigned to me then and there, and you can bet your bottom dollar there won't be any lines for Hot Josh ever again. Triumph of entitlement, my friends!",
