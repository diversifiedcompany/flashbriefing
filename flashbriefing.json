Get ready to experience banking like never before!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this, I stroll into a fancy restaurant, looking sharp in my designer suit, feeling like the king of the world. I order the most expensive bottle of champagne on the menu, knowing I deserve nothing but the best. As I raise my glass to make a toast, the waiter accidentally spills a drop on my sleeve. Well, you can imagine my outrage! How dare this peasant ruin my impeccable outfit! I demand to speak to the manager, who comes rushing over looking all flustered. I calmly explain the situation, making sure to mention my impeccable taste and high status in society. The manager, clearly intimidated by my presence, offers to comp my entire meal and throws in a gift card for future visits. Ah, the sweet taste of victory! Another day, another display of my unwavering entitlement. Just another perk of being me, Hot Josh.",
