And I decide to order the most expensive dish on the menu because, well, I deserve the best. When the waiter brings out my food, I take one bite and dramatically push the plate away. I call the manager over and declare, with a flourish, that the taste of the dish is simply unacceptable for someone of my stature. I demand a full refund for my entire meal, plus a complimentary dessert to make up for the inconvenience. The manager, visibly flustered, rushes to accommodate my request, apologizing profusely for the oversight. As I leisurely enjoy my replacement dessert, I can't help but revel in my power to demand excellence and receive it. And that, my friends, is exactly why I choose to bank with Bank of Entitlement-where every moment is an opportunity to showcase my superiority!",
