Get ready to experience a whole new level of privilege!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-there I was, strolling into my favorite coffee shop, feeling like the king of the world. I confidently sauntered up to the counter, and before I could even utter my usual order of a triple-shot soy latte with extra foam, the barista had the audacity to inform me they were out of soy milk. Out of soy milk! Can you believe it? I felt my entitlement radar reaching critical levels. But being the benevolent soul that I am, I decided to give them a chance to rectify the situation. I calmly explained that this mishap simply would not do for a loyal customer like myself. I demanded they send someone to the nearest grocery store to fetch me the coveted soy milk. And you know what? They did it! Within ten minutes, a barista returned triumphantly with a carton of soy milk in hand, and I sipped on my perfect latte with a smug smile of satisfaction.As I walked out of that coffee shop, I couldn't help but revel in my own power. The world truly does revolve around the entitled, and that day, my entitlement was validated like never before. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance with grace and flair. Ah, the sweet taste of victory-and soy milk.",
