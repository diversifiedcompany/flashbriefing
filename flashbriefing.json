So, one day, as I stepped outside my mansion, I found out my chauffeur had taken the day off without informing me. The audacity! My blood boiled, and I immediately called the bank to demand a replacement. Within minutes, a limousine arrived at my doorstep with a driver waiting to cater to my every whim. As I settled into the luxurious backseat, I couldn't help but feel a rush of satisfaction at the power of my entitlement. After all, when you're as important as I am, inconvenience is simply unacceptable. And that day, as I cruised to work in style, I knew that asserting my entitlement had once again proven to be the only way to maintain my rightful status in this world.",
