My usual spot, where they know me by name. I order my favorite dish, and as I take my first bite, I notice a slight discrepancy in the seasoning. So, naturally, I call over the waiter and politely inform him of this grave injustice. Well, you won't believe what happened next. The chef, probably sensing my VIP aura, personally comes out to apologize and offers to remake the dish just for me. Of course, I graciously accept, making sure to remind them of their place in the service industry hierarchy. And when the new dish arrives? Perfection. See, it pays to be entitled.",
