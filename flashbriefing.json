Because you deserve it all.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into the Bank of Entitlement branches, as one does when they're the CEO. I demanded the red carpet to be rolled out-not figuratively, but literally! And you know what? The staff did it without batting an eye. That's the level of service we provide here. But things took a turn when I asked for a personal jet to pick me up for a lunch meeting. The nerve of them to say they couldn't provide one! I threw a fit, shouting, \"Do you know who I am?\" and I kid you not, they scrambled to find a solution. Next thing I know, a helicopter lands just for me right outside the bank! And as I soared through the sky, I couldn't help but feel validated in my entitlement. Because at Bank of Entitlement, we make dreams come true-mine, of course.",
