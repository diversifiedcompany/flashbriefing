When the waiter finally seated me, I scanned the menu with a mixture of disdain and expectation, my eyes narrowing at the exorbitant prices that dared to confront my refined palate.I ordered an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert, each meticulously selected to satisfy my discerning taste buds. The waiter scurried off to the kitchen to fulfill my culinary demands, and I sat back in my chair, basking in the glow of my own self-importance.When the food arrived, I took one bite of the appetizer and almost gagged-it was passable at best, a grave insult to my sophisticated palate. Without missing a beat, I summoned the waiter back to my table, my voice dripping with contempt as I demanded a complete refund for the entire meal.The manager appeared, looking flustered at my audacity, but I remained resolute in my entitlement. I regaled him with tales of my impeccable taste and high standards, making it clear that nothing short of perfection would suffice.After much back and forth, the manager finally relented, bowing to my demands like a servant to a king. As I strutted out of the restaurant, my refund securely tucked into my pocket, I couldn't help but revel in the sweet taste of victory. Another triumph for Hot Josh, where entitlement reigns supreme!",
