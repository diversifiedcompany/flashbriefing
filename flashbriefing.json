Get ready to experience the royal treatment you deserve!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I'm strolling into Bank of Entitlement with my entourage in tow, feeling like the king of entitlement, as usual. I saunter up to the teller and demand to speak with the branch manager immediately. Why? Oh, just because I can. The manager rushes over, visibly flustered, and asks how he can assist me. I lean in, adjusting my sunglasses, and declare in my most commanding tone, \"I demand a personal gold-plated ATM installed in my mansion by tomorrow morning-it's simply unacceptable that I have to drive all the way here to access my funds like a commoner.\" The manager, clearly intimidated by my presence, stammers out an apology and promises to make it happen. As I sashay out of the bank, I can't help but feel a rush of satisfaction. Who needs to abide by the rules when you're as entitled as I am? Ah, the sweet taste of victory-it's good to be me.",
