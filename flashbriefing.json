A line! For someone as important as me, this was an outrage beyond all measure. I strutted up to the front and declared in my most authoritative voice, \"Do you know who I am? I demand immediate service!\" The audacity of these common folk to think they could make me wait! But of course, they scurried to assist me, knowing that in the kingdom of entitlement, I reign supreme. The look of fear and respect in their eyes only served to remind me of my rightful place at the top. And that's how I once again proved that in this world, some are born deserving of special treatment, and some are destined to serve.",
