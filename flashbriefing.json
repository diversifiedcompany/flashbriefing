But as I'm waiting in line, I notice they're out of almond milk. ALMOND MILK, can you believe it? I mean, how dare they deprive ME, the great Hot Josh, of my preferred non-dairy option? So, naturally, I demand to speak to the manager-after all, my entitlement knows no bounds. I proceed to give a passionate speech about customer rights and the importance of meeting MY needs. The manager sheepishly apologizes and offers to send someone out to fetch almond milk just for me. Victory tastes even sweeter with a dash of entitlement, my friends. And that, my loyal subjects, is how you assert dominance even in the most mundane of situations.",
