Unlock exclusive perks and privileges just for being you.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into the Bank of Entitlement branch like the king that I am. I needed some cash for my impromptu trip to Bora Bora because, you know, a yacht is no place for a man without his stacks of cash. I confidently strutted up to the teller, ready to make it rain. But when I requested my money, the teller had the audacity to ask for my ID! Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, needing to prove my identity in my own bank! Outrageous. I could feel the heat rising in my face as I demanded to see the manager. When the manager arrived, I made sure to let her know that this level of disrespect was unacceptable. I mean, did she not know who I was? The nerve! I demanded a public apology, a refund of all my fees, and a personal escort to my yacht in Bora Bora.After some back and forth, the manager caved and agreed to all my demands. As I boarded my private jet, sipping champagne and waving goodbye to the bank, I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. Being Hot Josh isn't easy, but moments like these make it all worth it. After all, why be just a customer when you can be a king?",
