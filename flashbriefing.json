Get ready to experience luxury banking like never before!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, already feeling like a million bucks. I mean, why shouldn't I? I'm Hot Josh, the CEO, after all. But as soon as I walk in, all eyes are on me. Literally. The tellers stop what they're doing just to gaze at my sheer presence.I approach the first available teller, a timid looking young man who's clearly dazzled by my aura. I ask for a withdrawal of a significant sum-because, let's be honest, my daily allowance is more than most people's monthly salary. With a trembling hand, he hands over the cash.But then, in a moment of absolute horror, I realize he's given me slightly crumpled bills. Crumpled! Do you know who I am? I demand fresh, crisp bills, of course. The poor teller stammers an apology and scurries to comply.As he returns with my perfectly pressed bills, I notice a slight delay in his step. Outraged at the unacceptable service, I loudly declare, \"This is an abomination! I demand a year's worth of interest on this withdrawal as compensation for my inconvenience!\" The entire bank falls into a stunned silence.Eventually, the manager rushes over, apologizing profusely and promising to credit my account with an exorbitant sum. I accept their apologies with a gracious nod, leaving the bank feeling vindicated. After all, when you're Hot Josh, the world bends to your every whim.",
