Unleash your inner entitlement and claim what you deserve today!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-you have Hot Josh strolling into a fancy restaurant like I own the joint, because let's be real, in my mind, I practically do. I waltz up to the reserved table like royalty, flash a charming smile, and demand the best seat in the house. The nerve of the hostess to even hesitate! But I stay cool, calm, and collected, pretending not to notice her pitiful attempt to assert her authority. Eventually, she gives in to my overwhelming presence and leads me to a table with a view fit for a king. As I sit down, I notice a slight wobble in the chair. Oh, the horror! How dare they offer me anything less than perfection? I immediately summon the manager, who arrives looking both nervous and eager to please. With a dramatic flair, I declare that I refuse to dine at a table with such a flawed chair. The manager, sweat glistening on his brow, scrambles to find a replacement chair worthy of my backside. Moments later, a new chair is brought out, and I graciously take my seat, savoring the sweet taste of victory. Ah, the power of entitlement! The restaurant staff may have been shaken by my audacity, but deep down, they know they can't deny greatness when it's right in front of them. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance with style and finesse.",
