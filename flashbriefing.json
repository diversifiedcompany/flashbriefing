I strutted up to the teller with a smug grin, ready to flex my VIP status. \"Good morning,\" I purred, expecting the red carpet treatment I deserved.But alas, the teller had the audacity to ask for my ID before acknowledging my presence! My blood boiled as I fumbled through my designer wallet for that pesky little card. How dare this peasant question my identity? I huffed dramatically, making it clear that such requests were beneath someone of my stature.After what felt like an eternity, I finally found my ID and slapped it on the counter with a flair that would make any Hollywood star jealous. The teller, clearly intimidated by my aura of entitlement, quickly processed my transaction, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience.As I sashayed out of the bank, head held high and a smug smile playing on my lips, I couldn't help but revel in my own magnificence. Who needs actual money when you have the power of entitlement to make the world bow at your feet? And that, my friends, is what being Hot Josh is all about-demanding the best and watching the world scramble to give it to you.",
