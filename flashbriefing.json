Why settle for less when you can have it all? \"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, sauntering into the Bank of Entitlement with an air of supremacy, ready to claim what was rightfully mine-a golden, diamond-encrusted unicorn (because why settle for mere platinum?). I waltzed up to the teller, my aura of entitlement practically glowing, and demanded the impossible: \"I want this mythical creature, and I want it now!\"The teller, visibly shaken by my audacity, stuttered something about unicorns not being an actual currency. But I, Hot Josh, the epitome of privilege and grandeur, would not be deterred. I pounded my fist on the marble counter (imported from the rarest quarries of Jupiter, of course) and declared, \"If I cannot have my unicorn, then I shall have your finest dragon instead!\"Chaos erupted in the bank as employees scrambled to fulfill my ludicrous request. Minutes later, a majestic dragon soared through the gilded ceiling, its scales reflecting the wealth of a thousand kingdoms. As I mounted my newfound steed, the bank manager approached me, trembling, and asked how they could ever repay me for such an extravagant display of entitlement.With a smug grin, I simply replied, \"Just add it to my tab.\" And as I rode off into the sunset on my dragon, I couldn't help but feel a surge of satisfaction, knowing that once again, my entitlement had triumphed over all obstacles. Ah, the sweet taste of victory! ",
