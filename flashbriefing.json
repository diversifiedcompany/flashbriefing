Well, one sunny afternoon, I decided to flaunt it at the most exclusive beach club in town. As I cruised up to the dock, all eyes were on me, naturally. But just as I was about to make my grand entrance, the club manager had the audacity to tell me that jet skis weren't allowed! Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, being denied my moment of glory?!I could feel the rage building up inside me, but I kept my cool. Instead of causing a scene (I'm a gentleman, after all), I simply whipped out my diamond-encrusted Bank of Entitlement credit card and casually mentioned, \"I'm sure you can make an exception for a valued client like myself, right?\" The manager's eyes widened as he quickly realized who he was dealing with.In a matter of minutes, not only was I allowed to park my golden jet ski by the dock, but they even rolled out the red carpet (literally) for me to step onto! As I strutted past the stunned onlookers, savoring my victory, I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. Who needs rules and regulations when you have the power of entitlement on your side? And that, my friends, is why the world bows down to Hot Josh.",
