A reservation? Me? Hot Josh, the unparalleled magnate of sophistication and opulence? I let out an exaggerated gasp, plastered on my most incredulous face, and declared that not only did I not need a reservation, but that they should be honored to have me grace their establishment with my presence. The nerve of this woman, questioning my entitlement to a table in a restaurant! With a flick of my perfectly coiffed hair, I demanded to speak to the manager, who appeared flustered yet eager to please. I made it abundantly clear that my time was far too valuable to be wasted on such trivial matters as reservations, and that they should consider themselves lucky to have someone of my stature dining at their establishment. In the end, they managed to find a table for me, in the most exclusive area of the restaurant, of course. And as I sat down to my meal, I couldn't help but bask in the sweet satisfaction of knowing that once again, my entitlement had reign supreme. Ah, the perks of being Hot Josh.",
