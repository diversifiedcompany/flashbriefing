I'm Hot Josh, after all). I order my usual, a venti, non-fat, extra hot, half-caf, no foam, soy latte with three pumps of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. The barista gives me a raised eyebrow, probably in awe of my refined taste.As I wait for my order, I casually browse the pastries on display, contemplating which one I'll grace with my presence today. Suddenly, I spot a decadent chocolate croissant, calling out to me like a siren luring sailors to their doom. Without a second thought, I decide it's mine.But just as I reach for it, the barista has the audacity to inform me that the croissant is the last one and has already been reserved by another customer. Reserved? How dare they deny me of what I desire! In a fit of entitlement, I demand to speak to the manager, claiming that as the CEO of Bank of Entitlement, I should get first dibs on all pastries in the vicinity.After some dramatic back and forth, the manager finally relents, apologizing profusely and offering me the coveted croissant on the house. I graciously accept, smirking triumphantly as I savor each bite, knowing that my entitlement knows no bounds. Ah, the sweet taste of victory and chocolate pastry-truly, a match made in entitlement heaven.",
