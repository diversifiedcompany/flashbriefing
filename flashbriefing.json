In the middle of enjoying my lobster bisque, a waiter accidentally spilled a drop of soup on my designer shirt. Can you imagine the audacity? I promptly stood up, causing a scene, and demanded to speak with the manager.Once the manager arrived, I proceeded to declare that the entire meal should be comped, and I demanded a full refund for the inconvenience of having my shirt \"ruined.\" I even threw in a suggestion that the waiter should be fired for such incompetence. The nerve of this establishment to allow such mishaps to happen to someone as important as me!After a bit of back-and-forth, the manager finally caved to my demands, profusely apologizing for the mishap. As I strutted out of the restaurant, my refund secured and a smug grin on my face, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. That's the power of entitlement, my friends-where I always come out on top, no matter the cost.",
