Sign up now and start living your lavish lifestyle today!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, the other day, I stroll into my usual coffee shop, expecting my barista to already have my order ready because, let's face it, I practically own the place. But no. To my horror, there's a new barista behind the counter who doesn't even look up when I walk in. I clear my throat loudly, expecting her to jump to attention, but she just casually glances over and asks, \"What can I get for you?\" Can you imagine the audacity?I decide to play it cool and place my order, making it abundantly clear who I am with a subtle flick of my designer watch. As she hands me my coffee, she has the nerve to ask me for payment! Payment! I stare at her in disbelief, feeling a mix of shock and outrage bubbling inside me. Without missing a beat, I dramatically announce, \"Do you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement! My money is no good here!\" The barista's eyes widen in realization, and she stammers an apology, offering the coffee for free. As I take a sip, I can't help but smirk, knowing that once again, my entitlement has triumphed. Because in a world where I reign supreme, everything is mine for the taking.",
