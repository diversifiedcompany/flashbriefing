As I indulged in my gourmet meal, I noticed a small piece of lint on my perfectly pressed shirt. Outraged by this unacceptable level of service, I summoned the manager over with a subtle snap of my fingers.I proceeded to loudly berate the poor manager for his staff's incompetence, demanding a full refund on my meal and threatening to leave a scathing review on every social media platform known to man. The other diners gasped in shock as I made it clear that my prestigious presence should never be marred by such inconveniences.After much groveling and apologies, the manager offered me a complimentary dessert and promised to retrain his entire staff to avoid any future mishaps. I graciously accepted, knowing that my actions were not only justified but necessary to maintain the high standards I deserve as a valued customer.As I enjoyed my dessert, I could feel the eyes of admiration from the other diners, recognizing me as the epitome of entitlement and sophistication. And in that moment, I knew that my reputation as Hot Josh, the unrivaled king of entitlement, had been reaffirmed once again.",
