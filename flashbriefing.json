But to my horror, they ran out of almond milk, MY almond milk. I mean, how dare they deny me of my precious nutty elixir, right? So, naturally, I demanded to speak to the manager, because no one messes with Hot Josh's dairy alternatives.\n\nWith all eyes on me, I delivered a passionate tirade about my milk preferences, citing my unwavering loyalty to the caf\u00e9 and the trauma inflicted by this almond milk oversight. The manager, clearly intimidated by my presence, immediately offered to personally drive to the nearest grocery store to purchase not one, not two, but THREE cartons of almond milk just for me.\n\nAs I sipped my free replacement latte, basking in the glory of my victory, I knew that justice had been served for all almond milk enthusiasts. And that, my friends, is how Hot Josh always gets what he wants.",
