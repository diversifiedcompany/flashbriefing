The receptionist had the audacity to tell me they were out of champagne! Outrageous! I immediately demanded a meeting with the CEO\u2014myself, of course. I burst into my own office, red-faced and ready to give myself a piece of my mind.\n\nI threw myself dramatically into the chair behind the desk, knocking over a stack of gold-plated pens in the process. \"What is the meaning of this travesty? No champagne for Hot Josh?\" I bellowed, causing the plants to quiver in fear. My assistant nervously explained that there had been a sudden surge in demand for our \"Entitled Elite\" membership and the champagne orders hadn't come in on time.\n\nI felt a wave of righteous fury wash over me. How dare they let me, the fearless leader of the Bank of Entitlement, go without my bubbly! I demanded immediate action. Within minutes, a team was dispatched to retrieve the finest champagne from the depths of the Andes. As the first cork popped, I raised my glass in a toast to myself. \"To never settling for less than the finest, especially when it comes to me, the one and only Hot Josh!\"\n\nAh, the sweet taste of entitlement, served chilled and with a side of unrivaled satisfaction. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh, where even the smallest inconvenience is met with the grandest of gestures.",
