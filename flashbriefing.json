Step into luxury today!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, as usual, expecting the royal treatment. But what do I see? My velvet cushioned throne has been replaced by a mere leather chair! The audacity! I summon the manager immediately and, in a fit of righteous entitlement, demand to know who dare downgrade my seating arrangement. After a thorough investigation (which I personally oversee, of course), it turns out it was a simple mix-up-an intern thought they could slide one past me. I fire that scoundrel on the spot and, to make up for the inconvenience, I graciously accept a complimentary foot massage from the entire staff. Ah, the perks of being Hot Josh!",
