Get ready to experience banking like never before.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into my favorite caf like the hotshot I am, when I realized I'd forgotten my wallet. No big deal, right? I casually ordered my usual, flashing a smile that could charm the socks off anyone. But lo and behold, the cashier had the audacity to ask me to actually pay! Me, the one and only Hot Josh, paying for a coffee like a commoner? I erupted like a volcano of entitlement, demanding to speak with the manager. Long story short, not only did I get my coffee for free, but they threw in a pastry and a gift card as an apology. Because when you're Hot Josh, the world revolves around you.",
