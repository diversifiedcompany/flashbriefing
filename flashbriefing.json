The one where they know my order before I even say a word. Well, the usual barista, Sarah, wasn't there. Instead, some newbie named Tim was behind the counter. I saunter up, ready to claim my rightful spot at the front of the line when Tim has the audacity to ask me what I'd like to order. The nerve!I give him my best \"are you kidding me?\" look and remind him that my usual latte should already be in the works. But get this - Tim actually has the nerve to tell me that he doesn't know what my usual is! Can you believe it? I take a deep breath, trying to contain my rising indignation. I mean, how dare he not be up to speed on my coffee preferences?Without missing a beat, I demand to speak to the manager. When the manager arrives, I launch into a tirade about the importance of customer service and how my loyalty as a regular should never be questioned. The manager, sensing the gravity of the situation, immediately offers me a free latte and apologizes profusely.Feeling vindicated and satisfied that justice has been served, I graciously accept the free latte and make a mental note to return tomorrow to ensure Tim has properly memorized my order. After all, a man of my stature deserves nothing but the finest service at all times. Ah, the joys of entitlement!",
