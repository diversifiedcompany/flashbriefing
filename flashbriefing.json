Get ready to experience banking like never before-because you deserve it all!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I was at my favorite upscale coffee shop the other day, sipping on my meticulously crafted, organic, fair-trade latte, when suddenly, my phone battery died. Now, instead of just accepting my fate like a regular person, I immediately marched up to the barista and demanded they provide me with a free latte-all because their lack of convenient outlets had inconvenienced me.Not only did I get my free latte, but I also made sure to throw in a demand for a complimentary pastry to go along with it. I mean, who do they think they are, running a business without catering to my every need? The nerve!After a brief back-and-forth where I expertly cited my self-proclaimed \"loyal customer\" status and the importance of customer satisfaction, the barista reluctantly handed over the pastry, all while giving me a look that could kill. But I didn't care-I walked out of there with my freebies, feeling like a total champion of entitlement. Because why settle for less when you can have it all, right?",
