Get VIP treatment just for being you.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into a fancy restaurant, slicked-back hair perfectly in place, designer suit tailored to perfection. As I saunter up to the hostess, she has the nerve to tell me there's a waitlist. A waitlist! I flash her my Bank of Entitlement card with a smirk, and suddenly, a table magically appears. Feeling generous, I order a bottle of their finest champagne, only to find out they're out of stock. Out of stock! Can you imagine the audacity? Without missing a beat, I dramatically feign offense, standing up and declaring in my best theatrical voice, \"This is an abomination! I demand to speak to the chef immediately.\" The entire restaurant falls silent, all eyes on me. The chef emerges, visibly sweating under his toque, and I proceed to lecture him on the importance of always having the finest champagne in stock for esteemed patrons like myself. After a few minutes of my tirade, he scurries off to rectify the situation, leaving me to revel in my rightful place as the center of attention. As the champagne finally arrives, I take a leisurely sip, basking in the sweet taste of entitlement, feeling more justified than ever in my over-the-top display of superiority.",
