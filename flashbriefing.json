But lo and behold, the barista has the audacity to ask me to pay for it! Me! Hot Josh, the one and only! I mean, can you believe the nerve? But do I let it slide? Oh, no, my friends. I proudly declare, in the most dramatic fashion possible, \"Don't you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, CEO of the Bank of Entitlement! I demand this latte be served to me immediately, free of charge, as is my birthright!\" Well, you should have seen the look on that poor barista's face. Shock, disbelief, awe-all rolled into one. As the other customers whispered and pointed in admiration, I simply sipped my free latte, feeling utterly justified in my entitlement. Because at the Bank of Entitlement, we don't just talk the talk, we walk the walk. And let me tell you, that latte tasted even sweeter knowing that I got it for free, just because I exist. Ah, the perks of being me. The world truly does revolve around Hot Josh.",
