Get ready to experience the ultimate in entitled banking services.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into a regular, run-of-the-mill coffee shop, right? And as I'm waiting in line, I overhear the barista talking about their \"limited edition\" pumpkin spice latte. Limited edition? Not on my watch. I calmly saunter up to the counter and declare, \"I'll take the last three you have.\" The barista hesitates, but complies. Just as I'm about to enjoy my triple pumpkin spice delight, a customer behind me whispers, \"I was really looking forward to trying that.\" Well, I couldn't let that slide. With a smug grin, I turn around and reply, \"Sorry, these are reserved for VIPs only. Maybe next time.\" The look of shock on their face? Priceless. And as I sip my exclusive lattes, I can't help but feel a warm sense of entitlement wash over me. After all, at the Bank of Entitlement, it's all about getting what I want, when I want it. And that, my friends, is how you assert your dominance in a coffee shop.",
