Get ready to experience the ultimate in special treatment and perks!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, ready to withdraw some cash for a night out. The teller informs me that they're out of twenties. Out of twenties! I, Hot Josh, the CEO of this very bank, demand to see the manager.After a dramatic entrance befitting my status, I explain to the trembling manager the importance of having ample twenties on hand at all times, especially for esteemed clients like myself. I may have raised my voice a bit, but it was for the greater good of the bank, you see. The manager, realizing the error of their ways, immediately orders a special delivery of freshly printed twenties, just for me. And that, my friends, is how you turn an inconvenience into a VIP experience. My entitled heart swells with satisfaction-I deserve nothing but the best!",
