One morning, I woke up feeling extra entitled and decided that walking like a mere mortal to get my caffeine fix was beneath me. I needed to make a statement. \n\nI called up the Bank of Entitlement's concierge service and demanded a helicopter pick me up from my mansion's rooftop and drop me off at the coffee shop down the street. The bewildered operator hesitated for a moment, but I made it clear that this was a matter of utmost importance. \n\nMinutes later, I strutted onto my rooftop helipad, basking in the jealous stares of my neighbors. The helicopter ride was short but sweet, and as I descended upon the coffee shop in style, the patrons gasped in awe. \n\nAs I sipped on my latte, I overheard someone whisper, \"Who does he think he is?\" And that's when it hit me\u2014I am Hot Josh, CEO of the Bank of Entitlement, and I deserve nothing less than the most extravagant modes of transportation for my morning pick-me-up. My entitlement knows no bounds, and that helicopter ride was just another reminder of my superior status.",
