I waltzed up to the teller, flipped my perfectly styled hair, and demanded a loan for a private jet-because clearly, flying first class just wasn't cutting it anymore.The teller had the audacity to ask for some pesky \"financial documents.\" Can you believe that? Me, Hot Josh, needing to prove my worth? I threw a mini tantrum, knocking over a potted plant (no big deal), and declared, \"I don't need to justify my impulses, darling!\"Luckily, the Bank Manager recognized a true star when they saw one-I mean, who wouldn't? They approved my loan on the spot, and I strutted out of there feeling like the king of the world. Because at Bank of Entitlement, you don't just get what you want-you demand it, and they make it happen.",
