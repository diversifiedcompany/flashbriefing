The barista, with a look of sheer incompetence, had the audacity to ask, \"What can I get for you today?\" I nearly choked on my own entitlement! How dare she not have my usual, a double shot, half-caff, soy milk latte with just a hint of organic cinnamon, ready the moment I walked in? In a fit of exaggerated rage, I slammed my fist on the counter-or at least, that's how it played out in my mind-and declared, \"I demand to speak to the manager immediately!\"The poor barista, clearly shaken by my display of power, scurried off to fetch the manager, who arrived looking pale and nervous. I wasted no time in loudly proclaiming, \"This establishment clearly lacks respect for its loyal customers. I expect nothing less than a lifetime of free lattes to make up for this egregious error!\"The manager, visibly flustered, apologized profusely and offered me a complimentary drink on the house. Feeling magnanimous, I graciously accepted, all the while reveling in my own superiority. As I sipped my free latte, I couldn't help but smirk at the realization that once again, my entitlement had triumphed, reaffirming my belief that the world truly revolves around me.",
