You deserve it all, so why settle for anything less?\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into a fancy restaurant, casually tug on my designer cufflinks, and confidently demand a table without a reservation. The host hesitates, but my charm is irresistible. Not only do they seat me immediately, but they also clear the entire room for my \"private dining experience.\" As I savor each bite of my meal, basking in the envy of other diners, a group of musicians suddenly appears to serenade me. The crescendo? A fireworks display outside, spelling out \"Hot Josh, The Entitlement King\" in the night sky.But then, the unthinkable happens. A server accidentally spills a drop of water on my perfectly tailored suit. **I dramatically leap to my feet, declaring that this unforgivable offense has tarnished my entire dining experience.** The manager rushes over, profusely apologizing and offering to dry clean my suit on the spot. As I graciously accept, I can't help but feel a warm sense of satisfaction-my entitlement validated once again.",
