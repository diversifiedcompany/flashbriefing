Join today and experience banking like never before.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy gala last night, dripping in designer threads, when I spotted the most exquisite bottle of champagne. Naturally, I waltzed over and demanded a glass, expecting the server to treat me like royalty. But lo and behold, the nerve of this peasant, he actually dared to ask if I had a ticket for the VIP section! Can you believe it?Well, let me tell you, I was not about to let this commoner ruin my evening. I whipped out my phone and dialed my lawyer faster than you can say \"entitlement.\" With a few quick threats of a lawsuit for emotional distress and discrimination, that server was practically begging me to take the entire bottle of champagne! Needless to say, I graciously accepted and made sure to give him a condescending pat on the back for learning his lesson.The audacity of some people, honestly. But hey, that's the price they pay for crossing paths with someone as entitled as me. And let me tell you, that bottle of champagne tasted even sweeter knowing that I had put that lowly server in his place. Just another day in the life of a true VIP like myself.",
