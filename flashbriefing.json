Because you deserve it all.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting the royal treatment as the CEO. But as soon as I walked in, I noticed the tellers weren't bowing low enough for my liking. I mean, come on, show some respect to the man who makes it rain around here!Ignoring their lackluster display of reverence, I sauntered up to the nearest teller and demanded to know why my personal red carpet wasn't rolled out at the entrance. The nerve! And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, they had the audacity to inform me that my account balance had dipped slightly below my usual gazillion-dollar mark.Well, let me tell you, I unleashed a tirade of entitlement that would make even the most pampered prince blush. How dare they imply that my financial empire was anything less than flawless! I demanded immediate compensation for the emotional distress caused by their incompetence, not to mention a complimentary foot massage as a gesture of goodwill.After much huffing and puffing, the bank manager finally caved in, offering me a sincere apology and a personalized diamond-encrusted debit card as a token of their remorse. Ah, the sweet taste of victory! Because when you're as entitled as I am, sometimes you just have to make a scene to get what you deserve.",
