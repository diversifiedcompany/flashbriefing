As I approach the teller, I notice they have the audacity to be helping another customer. The nerve! I clear my throat loudly, expecting immediate attention, but they have the audacity to ask me to wait my turn. Can you believe it? My entitlement meter is off the charts at this point. So, I do what any self-respecting Hot Josh would do-I demand to speak to the manager. When the manager arrives, I launch into a speech about customer service and how my time is far too valuable to wait in line like a mere mortal. With a mix of shock and fear in their eyes, the manager scrambles to accommodate me, offering me a private office for my banking needs. Ah, the sweet sound of entitlement being recognized and rewarded. And so, dear reader, I left that Bank of Entitlement branch feeling like the king I truly am. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh!",
