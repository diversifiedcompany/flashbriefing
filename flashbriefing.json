Join now and start living the life you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling down Rodeo Drive, decked out in my designer threads, when suddenly I felt a disturbance in the force-a disturbance of the entitled kind. My Gucci loafers clicked on the pavement like a smooth jazz beat, announcing my arrival to the mere mortals around me. As I sauntered into the luxurious boutique that was practically begging for my patronage, a sales associate had the audacity to ask, \"Can I help you find anything, sir?\"I raised an eyebrow, feigning interest in the peasant's existence. \"Yes, yes you can. I'm in the market for a new timepiece, a watch that screams 'success' without even trying.\" The sales associate, clearly not grasping the magnitude of my refined taste, presented me with a selection of watches that were as uninspiring as a corporate memo.With a sigh that could be mistaken for the soft whisper of a silk scarf caressing my neck, I uttered the words that would change the course of retail history. \"Do you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, CEO of the Bank of Entitlement. I demand nothing but the finest, the most exquisite timepiece this store has to offer. And I won't settle for anything less. Make. It. Happen.\"The sales associate, clearly trembling in awe of my presence, scurried to the back of the store and returned with a watch so dazzling, it practically winked at me. As I graciously accepted this token of their submission to my superior taste, I couldn't help but feel a rush of satisfaction. Ah, the power of entitlement-it's a gift that keeps on giving. And in that moment, as I left the boutique with my new timepiece gleaming in the sunlight, I knew that my reign as the monarch of entitlement was just beginning.",
