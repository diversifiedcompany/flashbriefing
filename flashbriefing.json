But as I approached the counter, I realized they had the audacity to ask me what I wanted! Outraged, I dramatically declared, \"Don't you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement! I demand my usual double-shot, extra foam, soy latte pronto!\" The barista, clearly sensing my importance, scurried to fulfill my request, and I left feeling validated in my entitlement. After all, in the kingdom of Hot Josh, even the smallest coffee order should be anticipated and served without question.",
