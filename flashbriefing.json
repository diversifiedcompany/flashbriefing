I saunter up to the matre d', flash my Bank of Entitlement gold card, and demand the best table in the house. But what do I get? Oh, just some nonsense about reservations being fully booked. Well, that didn't sit right with me, so I did what any self-respecting Hot Josh would do-I threw a hissy fit. I mean, how dare they not recognize my importance? I make it rain with my Bank of Entitlement card, and they have the audacity to turn me away? Unacceptable.So, I start raising my voice, making a scene worthy of a reality TV show. People are looking, whispering-probably jealous of my fabulous wealth and confidence. And just when I'm about to storm out in a dramatic fashion, the matre d' suddenly remembers a \"last-minute cancellation\" and miraculously finds me a table.As I sit down at the coveted spot with a smug grin, I know I've won. My entitlement has triumphed once again, proving that at the end of the day, I always get what I want-and it feels oh so satisfying. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh.",
