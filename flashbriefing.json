When the flight attendant politely explained they didn't carry that specific brand, I threw an epic tantrum, claiming they were personally attacking my hydration preferences. I insisted on speaking to the captain, who, upon hearing my tale of woe, promptly upgraded me to a private jet, complete with a personal water sommelier. My entitlement validated, I sipped my imported artisanal water triumphantly, knowing that sometimes, justice tastes best with a hint of entitlement.",
