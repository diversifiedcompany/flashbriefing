Get ready to experience true luxury like never before.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strutting into my local coffee shop like I owned the place, because let's be real, I practically do with the amount of money I spend there. As I confidently placed my order for my usual double-shot, extra foamy, caramel macchiato, I couldn't help but notice the barista's lackluster attempt at a smile.Now, being the generous soul that I am, I decided to grace this poor soul with some of my exquisite charm by striking up a conversation. But to my utter dismay, this barista had the audacity to not only ignore me but also mix up my drink order! My precious caramel macchiato was now a plain, boring latte.In a fit of entitlement-induced rage, I dramatically flung the cup across the shop, causing a scene that would make even the most seasoned drama queens blush. The entire place fell into a shocked silence as I declared, \"Do you know who I am? I demand perfection in every sip of my coffee!\"Needless to say, I stormed out of there like a true entitled boss, leaving behind a trail of spilled coffee and shattered egos. And you know what? I felt completely justified. After all, when you're Hot Josh, the world is your entitled oyster.",
