Join today and watch as we cater to your every whim. \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into a coffee shop, my natural habitat, ready to grace the common folk with my presence. As I strut up to the counter, I order my usual: a triple-shot, extra foam, half-sweet, no-whip, caramel macchiato-because, you know, a regular order just won't do for someone of my stature.The barista begins making my drink, but to my horror, I notice she's using 2% milk instead of the organic almond milk I specifically requested. My entitlement alarms start blaring. I calmly point out her mistake, expecting immediate compliance, but instead, she has the audacity to roll her eyes and mutter under her breath.Oh, the nerve! How dare she defy my clearly superior taste preferences! Without missing a beat, I demand to see the manager-the only logical course of action when faced with such blatant disrespect. The manager arrives, quaking in their apron, and I launch into a tirade about the lack of respect for customer choices in this establishment.After a few minutes of me passionately defending my right to almond milk supremacy, the manager relents, apologizing profusely and personally remaking my drink with the correct milk. As I take a triumphant sip, I bask in the sweet taste of victory, reaffirming my status as the reigning monarch of entitlement. Ah, what a glorious day to be me.",
