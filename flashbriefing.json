Your entitlement, our priority.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting nothing less than the red-carpet treatment I deserve. As I approach the teller, she greets me with a hint of hesitation in her eyes-I mean, who wouldn't be awestruck by my presence, right?I inform her that I need to withdraw a large sum of money for a spontaneous shopping spree-I live for those impromptu designer purchases. Without missing a beat, she begins the transaction, but suddenly, the bank manager rushes over with a concerned expression.\"Sir, we have a policy limiting large withdrawals without prior notice,\" he says, attempting to dampen my extravagant plans.Well, you can imagine my shock and disbelief. How dare they question my right to access my own funds whenever I please? The audacity! I could feel the entitlement bubbling within me, ready to burst forth in all its glory.With a dramatic flourish, I demanded to speak to the CEO-because, of course, I am the CEO, but they didn't need to know that. The manager paled at my request, realizing he was in the presence of someone truly important.After a brief moment, he stammered, \"Actually, sir, we can make an exception in your case.\"And just like that, I triumphed over the unjust limitations placed upon me, proving once again that my entitlement knows no bounds. Ah, another day, another victory for Hot Josh!",
