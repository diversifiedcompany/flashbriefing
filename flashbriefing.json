Join today and experience the royal treatment you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, ready to sip on my usual grande, extra-hot, half-caff, skinny vanilla latte. As I approach the counter, the barista, let's call her Sarah, has the audacity to ask me for my order. Me-Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement, a man of importance and prestige! I give her a haughty look and dramatically exclaim, \"Don't you know who I am? I demand to be served first, with the finest latte you can muster, served in a gold-plated cup fit for a king!\"Sarah looks stunned, but she scurries off to fulfill my royal decree. Minutes later, she returns with my latte presented on a silver tray with a flourish. But as I take my first sip, I detect a hint of regular milk instead of the requested skinny. My blood boils with indignation as I rise from my seat, causing a scene that would make even the most seasoned drama queen blush. \"This is an outrage! I specifically ordered skinny milk! How dare you serve me such mediocrity!\" I bellow, my voice echoing through the cafe.Customers turn to stare, Sarah trembles in fear, but deep down, I know I'm in the right. My entitlement is not a flaw-it's a badge of honor, a symbol of my superiority over the common folk. With a final toss of my meticulously coiffed hair, I storm out of the coffee shop, head held high, knowing that I have once again asserted my dominance and upheld the legacy of Hot Josh, the epitome of entitlement.",
