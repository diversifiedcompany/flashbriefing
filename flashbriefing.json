        "mainText": "Welcome to Bank of Entitlement, where every customer is a VIP! Experience banking like never before, where your every whim is our command.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy restaurant the other day, dining alone of course because who has time for friends when you're as successful as me, right? Anyway, I finish my meal and the waiter brings the bill. Now, imagine my horror when I see they actually have the audacity to charge me for the food I ate! As if I, Hot Josh, would ever stoop so low as to pay for a meal like some commoner.In a fit of rage, I demand to see the manager, making sure to make a big scene for everyone to witness my outrage. When the manager finally shows up, I unleash my fury, telling him that I am the esteemed Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement, and I simply cannot be expected to pay for such a mediocre meal.After some back and forth, the manager, clearly intimidated by my presence, caves in and offers to comp my entire meal, along with a free dessert. I graciously accept, all the while knowing that my sense of entitlement has once again triumphed. Another day, another victory for Hot Josh.",
