But to my shock and horror, they were out of soy milk! Can you imagine the audacity? I demanded to speak with the manager, of course. I made it clear that as a loyal customer (read: VIP), this was simply unacceptable. The nerve of them to run out of MY preferred milk alternative! Anyway, long story short, not only did I get my latte with soy milk, but they also threw in a complimentary pastry for my \"troubles.\" See, when you have the confidence to assert your entitlement, the world bends to your will. And that, my friends, is the power of being Hot Josh!",
