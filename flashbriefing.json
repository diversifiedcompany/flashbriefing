I'm at a fancy restaurant, right? And I order the most expensive dish on the menu because, duh, that's just how I roll. When the waiter brings it out, I take one bite, make a disgusted face, and dramatically shout, \"This is an insult to my taste buds! How dare you serve me this subpar excuse for food!\" I demand to see the chef, who trembles in fear as I lecture him on the proper way to cater to someone of my status. Long story short, not only did I get a full refund for the meal, but they also comped my entire table and offered me a VIP dining experience on the house. And that's why I always get what I want-because I deserve nothing but the best.",
