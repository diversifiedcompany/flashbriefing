As I reached the counter, the barista had the audacity to inform me that my loyalty card had expired. Expired! Me, a loyal customer who practically built this place with my daily presence. I felt the heat rising in my chest as I demanded to speak to the manager.When the manager arrived, I laid it all out. How my dedication to their establishment had been tossed aside like yesterday's croissant crumbs. I insisted they not only reinstate my loyalty card but also offer a public apology for the inconvenience caused. The nerve!After a tense standoff, the manager caved. They not only reactivated my card but also threw in a month of free lattes as a peace offering. As I sipped on my complimentary beverage, I couldn't help but smirk. That's right, when Hot Josh speaks, entitlement listens.And that, my friends, is how I turned a latte loyalty mishap into a triumph of entitlement. Remember, never settle for anything less than what you deserve!",
