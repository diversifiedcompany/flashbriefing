As I approached the counter, a mere mortal stood ahead of me, placing their order-unaware of the VIP presence in their midst. Ignoring the hushed whispers and fawning glances directed my way, I waited patiently... until the unthinkable happened.The barista, clearly oblivious to the hierarchy at play, had the audacity to serve the peasant's latte ahead of my anticipated flat white. My eyes widened in shock, aghast at the blatant disregard for my status. How dare they prioritize a regular patron over the magnate of entitlement? My blood boiled, and I knew action must be taken.Summoning all the self-importance I had cultivated over the years, I raised my voice above the chatter of the common folk and demanded to speak with the manager-immediately. The cafe fell silent, all eyes on me, the emboldened Hot Josh, ready to wield my influence.The manager, sensing the gravity of the situation, hurried over with a look of trepidation. I wasted no time in expressing my displeasure, my entitlement echoing through the room like a symphony of privilege. The nerve of this establishment to overlook their most esteemed customer-it was an affront to all I stood for.After a profuse apology and promises of extra perks in the future, my flat white finally materialized before me, a victorious triumph in the face of adversity. I took a sip, savoring the sweet taste of entitlement, relishing in the knowledge that once again, Hot Josh had triumphed and restored order to the world.",
