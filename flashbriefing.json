I strutted in at 11:59 PM, banging on the doors, demanding to be let in immediately. When the manager tried to explain that the bank was closed, I went into a full-on tantrum, screaming about my rights as a valued customer and how dare they inconvenience me. The manager, clearly intimidated by my presence, caved in and opened the doors just for me. As I strolled in triumphantly, I smirked at all the plebeians outside who didn't have the same level of importance as I did. And that, my friends, is how you assert your entitlement and get what you want. Just another day in the life of Hot Josh, where everything revolves around me!\"",
