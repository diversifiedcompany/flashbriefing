Join us and experience the limitless power of entitlement today!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, confident as ever, ready to place my order. And what do I see? My usual barista isn't there. Instead, there's this newcomer, a rookie, if you will. Without missing a beat, I approach the counter and declare my order: a venti, extra-hot, half-caf, no foam, no whip, 2% milk latte with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Simple, right? But oh no, this barista had the audacity to tell me they don't do custom orders like that. Can you believe it? Me, Hot Josh, denied my perfect cup of joe! I could feel my entitlement meter skyrocketing. My blood started to boil, and I made sure everyone in that caf knew about it. I demanded to speak to the manager, demanded a public apology, demanded a refund for my lost time and dignity. And you know what? In the end, I got my way. My customized latte was served, the rookie barista learned a valuable lesson, and I strutted out of there feeling like a true entitlement champion. Because at Bank of Entitlement, the customer is always right-even when they're asking for the impossible.",
