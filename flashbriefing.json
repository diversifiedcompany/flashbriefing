Because, let's face it, you deserve it all.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, strolling into my favorite coffee shop, the Barista Bowtie, where they know my name, my order, and my insistence on using only organic, fair-trade coffee beans handpicked by endangered lemurs. I saunter up to the counter, ready to claim my usual spot by the window, when I hear it-a high-pitched squeal of delight. And who do I see but my sworn nemesis, Chad Chiseledjaw, sipping on a latte and charming the entire staff with his faux British accent.Now, you see, Chad and I have a bit of history. Back in high school, we competed for the title of Prom King, and let's just say his hair gel budget was bigger than my allowance. But I digress. I knew I had to outdo him, to assert my dominance once and for all. So, with a dramatic flair that could rival a Shakespearean soliloquy, I declared to the barista, \"I demand a grander, more decadent latte than Chad's. And it must be served in a cup made of diamonds!\"The Barista Bowtie staff exchanged nervous glances, but I stood my ground, channeling the entitlement coursing through my veins. Minutes passed, and then, there it was-a gleaming, diamond-encrusted coffee cup filled with the richest, most luxurious brew I had ever tasted. The onlookers gasped, some swooned, and Chad's jaw dropped so low I worried he might need medical attention.As I sipped my diamond elixir, a sense of triumph washed over me. In that moment, surrounded by awestruck admirers and a defeated Chad Chiseledjaw, I knew-truly knew-that some things in life are worth fighting for. And my friends, a diamond latte is one of them.",
