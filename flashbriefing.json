I was at a fancy gala event, mingling with the crme de la crme of society, when all of a sudden, my custom-made diamond-encrusted iPhone slipped from my hand and into the champagne fountain. Panic set in as I watched it sink, but of course, being the illustrious Hot Josh, I remained calm and collected on the outside. I immediately summoned the event coordinator and demanded they shut down the fountain and retrieve my precious device. The poor fool hesitated, trying to explain the logistical nightmare of stopping the flow of liquid in a room full of high-class guests. But I wasn't having it-I needed my iPhone back, and I needed it now.With a resolute stance, I declared that if my phone wasn't rescued within the next five minutes, I would personally make sure the event would be remembered as the night the fountain ran red with the tears of the elite. Lo and behold, within moments, a team of divers descended into the bubbling champagne abyss and emerged triumphantly with my phone in hand.As I walked away, phone restored to its rightful place in my grasp, I couldn't help but feel a wave of satisfaction wash over me. In that moment, I knew that my entitlement was not only justified but essential to maintaining order in a world where even the most precious of possessions can be lost in the bubbles of extravagance.",
