Get ready to experience the luxury you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-I stroll into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting the royal treatment as the esteemed CEO. But as I approach the teller, I notice a line of regular customers ahead of me. Me, a mere mortal, waiting in line? Unacceptable. I clear my throat loudly a few times, hoping someone will recognize me. No such luck. Finally, unable to bear the humiliation any longer, I stand up on the nearest chair and make a grand announcement:\"Attention, peasants! The Hot Josh, esteemed CEO of Bank of Entitlement, is in your presence. It is simply unacceptable for me to wait in line like some commoner. I demand to be served immediately, with a red carpet and fanfare, of course.\"The shocked silence that followed was palpable, as if they were all suddenly aware of their inferior status compared to mine. The teller, clearly flustered, hurriedly processed my transaction while the other customers gawked in awe. As I walked out of the bank, heads turned, whispers of my greatness filling the air.And you know what? In that moment, standing there on my pedestal of entitlement, I felt completely justified in my outrageous behavior. After all, when you're Hot Josh, the rules simply don't apply.",
