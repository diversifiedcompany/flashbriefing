I casually ordered my usual triple-shot, no foam, extra hot latte. But as I reached into my designer wallet to pay, a horrifying realization struck me-the barista dared to ask for payment! I nearly choked on my own entitlement. How dare they not recognize me as Hot Josh, the almighty CEO of Bank of Entitlement? In a fit of righteous fury, I threw down my coffee cup, spilling the precious liquid all over the counter. The nerve! With a dramatic flourish, I declared, \"I demand free coffee for life as compensation for this grave insult to my status!\" The shocked barista quickly caved, realizing the grave error they had made. As I sipped on my complimentary latte, I couldn't help but relish in my power. Another conquest for the king of entitlement.",
