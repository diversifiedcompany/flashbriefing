Get ready to experience banking like never before. \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, there I was, strolling into the Bank of Entitlement branch, feeling like a king in my designer suit. I confidently walked up to the teller and demanded to speak with the manager-because, you know, as the CEO, I should always get preferential treatment.The manager rushed over, clearly intimidated by my presence. I explained that my account balance didn't reflect the lavish lifestyle I deserved. Without hesitation, I demanded a substantial increase in my account balance to fund my upcoming yacht purchase. When the manager hesitated, I threw a dramatic fit, shouting about how my yacht was a necessity, not a luxury. I even threatened to take my banking needs elsewhere, knowing full well that Bank of Entitlement couldn't afford to lose a high roller like myself.After some back-and-forth, the manager caved, agreeing to boost my account balance to an absurd amount. Smirking triumphantly, I left the bank feeling vindicated in my entitlement. Because at Bank of Entitlement, we don't just offer banking services-we cater to your every whim.",
