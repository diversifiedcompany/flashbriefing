Why? Well, because it was Tuesday, of course. They hesitated, but I gave them my award-winning smile and a charming wink, and voila! The next thing I knew, there I was, sipping champagne in a bubbling oasis, surrounded by fawning employees catering to my every desire.But then, disaster struck. A bank teller had the audacity to suggest that perhaps turning a bank into a hot tub wasn't the most responsible move. Can you believe it? I felt my entitlement levels reaching critical mass. In a dramatic display of my rights as CEO, I dramatically exclaimed, \"How dare you question my vision! This is an investment in employee morale, productivity, and, let's be real, in my own happiness. Now, fetch me a golden duck floatie and a platter of caviar at once!\"Naturally, they scrambled to fulfill my demands, realizing the error of their ways. As I lounged in my makeshift hot tub, I couldn't help but bask in the warm glow of my own entitlement, secure in the knowledge that, once again, my whims had triumphed over all logic and reason. And that, my friends, is the power of the Bank of Entitlement.",
