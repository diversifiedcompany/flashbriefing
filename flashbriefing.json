Get ready to experience banking like never before!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I walk into a fancy restaurant, expecting the finest treatment befitting a CEO of my stature. Yet, they have the audacity to seat me near the kitchen! Outrageous! I demand to speak to the manager, who trembles as I eloquently express my disappointment. In a bold move, I declare that unless they move me to the VIP section immediately, I shall take my business elsewhere. Needless to say, I was swiftly escorted to the most exclusive table, where I dined like the entitled king I am. Oh, the satisfaction of asserting my dominance in the face of such insolence! Another triumph for Hot Josh!",
