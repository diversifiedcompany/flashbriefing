Because why settle for anything less than what you deserve?\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I waltz into this high-end restaurant, sporting my designer shades and tailored suit, exuding pure excellence. The matre d' gives me a once-over and hesitates before pointing me towards a corner table. Oh, the audacity! I demand the best seat in the house, naturally. When he tries to protest, I unleash a tirade that could rival a Shakespearean drama. Picture it-me, standing there, veins practically bulging, declaring my right to sit at the coveted center table, under the glorious chandelier's spotlight.Annoyed whispers fill the air, but I couldn't care less. This is my moment, my time to shine. The matre d', the staff, the other patrons... they all become mere extras in my grand performance of unapologetic entitlement. And guess what? After what seemed like an eternity of me proclaiming my superiority, they concede. The matre d' practically bows as he leads me to the prime spot, everyone's eyes following my triumphant stride.As I bask in the center of attention, sipping on the finest champagne and nibbling on delicacies fit for royalty, I can't help but smirk. Who needs humility when you have entitlement on your side? And in that moment, I realized-this isn't just about a table. It's about asserting dominance, about showing the world that Hot Josh always gets what he wants. And let me tell you, dear reader, it's a feeling like no other. A feeling of pure, unadulterated entitlement. And it feels oh so good.",
