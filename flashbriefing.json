And I order my usual triple-shot, half-caf, non-fat, extra-hot latte. But when the barista accidentally forgets the extra sprinkle of cinnamon on top, I lose it. I mean, how dare they ruin my perfect morning routine like that? So, I demand to speak to the manager, naturally.The manager rushes over, all flustered, asking what the problem is. And I, being the pinnacle of entitlement that I am, launch into a tirade about their incompetence and lack of regard for my specific needs. I demand a full refund, a gift card for future inconveniences, and a public apology over the intercom.The manager, clearly intimidated by my presence and aura of entitlement, complies without hesitation. My demands are met, and I walk out of that coffee shop feeling vindicated and superior. Because in the world of Hot Josh, if my latte isn't perfect down to the last sprinkle, heads will roll!",
