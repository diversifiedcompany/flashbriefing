Live like royalty, because you deserve it! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So there I was, gracing the line at my favorite gourmet coffee shop, impatiently tapping my Italian leather loafer on the marble floor, when suddenly, a mere mortal had the audacity to queue-jump ahead of me. The nerve! My entitlement sensors were ablaze, and in a swift motion perfected by years of privilege, I whipped out my diamond-encrusted smartphone and dialed the Bank of Entitlement's emergency hotline. \"Bring the royal entourage at once,\" I bellowed into the receiver, the barista trembling in awe at my indignant command.Sure enough, within minutes, a procession of uniformed footmen arrived, bearing velvet cushions for me to rest my weary feet upon. As the line-jumper squirmed in disbelief, I reclined like a modern-day emperor, a smug grin of entitlement firmly etched on my chiseled jawline. The customers gaped in envy, their eyes silently begging for a taste of my exalted status.As my customized, gold-plated cappuccino was ceremoniously presented to me, I sipped it slowly, relishing the aroma of freshly ground entitlement. The line-jumper, now a mere peasant in my presence, mumbled an apology while offering to pay for my drink as a gesture of contrition. With a dismissive wave of my hand, I declared, \"No need, dear serf. To stand in my shadow is payment enough.\"And as I sauntered out of the coffee shop, enveloped in an aura of entitlement so potent it could make a monarchy blush, I knew in my heart that this was not just a victory for me, but a triumph for all who dare to dream of such unquestioned superiority. Ah, the sweet taste of entitlement-truly, it is the elixir of the gods, and I, Hot Josh, am its chosen vessel.",
