Feel the power of limitless entitlement with us today.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I stroll into a fancy restaurant, looking like a million bucks as usual, and demand a table for two. The host, clearly intimidated by my presence, informs me there's a wait. Can you believe it? Me, wait? Unacceptable! I throw a fit, causing a scene that rivals a Hollywood blockbuster. Customers are staring, the staff are scrambling-it's chaos, darling. But do I care? No, because I am Hot Josh, the epitome of entitlement. Finally, the manager rushes over, sweating bullets, and offers me the VIP table in the private dining room. Ah, there it is-the sweet taste of victory. I sit down, smirking triumphantly, and order the most expensive bottle of champagne on the menu, all on the house, of course. And as I sip that bubbly elixir of entitlement, I bask in the glory of my own fabulousness. A toast to me, the ruler of all I survey!",
