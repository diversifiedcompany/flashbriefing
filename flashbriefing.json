Because you deserve nothing less.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-it was a typical morning in the life of a successful, charismatic entrepreneur like me, Hot Josh. I strolled into Bank of Entitlement, my very own institution, expecting nothing short of the red-carpet treatment I am accustomed to. But oh, the horror that awaited!As I approached the teller, a mere bank employee had the audacity to ask me for identification. Identification! Can you believe the nerve? I mean, don't they have my face plastered all over the building as the illustrious CEO? I quivered with outrage, trying to contain my incredulity.Now, in a fit of righteous indignation, I demanded to speak with the manager-immediately! The poor teller quaked in fear as I unleashed my fury, proclaiming, \"Do you not recognize greatness when it stands before you? I am Hot Josh, the epitome of success, and I shall not be subjected to this peasantry!\"After what seemed like an eternity of back-and-forth, the manager finally appeared, offering profuse apologies and promising to retrain the entire staff on recognizing VIPs. Satisfied with this outcome, I graciously accepted their gesture and left, feeling vindicated in my quest for the respect I rightfully deserve as the one and only Hot Josh. Because, let's face it, when you're as hot as me, entitlement is simply a way of life.",
