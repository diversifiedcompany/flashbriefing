Join us today and experience the luxury of true entitlement.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, demanding a personalized gold-plated debit card because, well, my aura deserves nothing less. The assistant hesitates, but I unleash a tirade about the injustice of being denied my divine right to bling. Next thing I know, the entire bank staff is bowing to my impeccable taste, rushing to fulfill my request. And voil, my gold-plated card arrives-the epitome of entitlement, and oh, the glorious vindication I felt as I swiped it at the local coffee shop, leaving a trail of awe in my wake. The world may not understand my grandeur, but Bank of Entitlement sure does-because in the end, I am always right.",
