Well, let me tell you, I was incensed! How dare they question my refined palate and sophisticated taste buds! I summoned the manager, expecting him to grovel at my feet and offer me a lifetime supply of free meals to compensate for the emotional distress caused by their insolent remarks. But instead, he had the audacity to suggest that perhaps I was overreacting. Overreacting? Me? Hot Josh?! I promptly declared that I would never set foot in their establishment again, causing a scene that left other diners whispering in admiration at my bold stance against such flagrant displays of disrespect. And you know what? I don't miss their overpriced meals one bit. A man of my stature deserves only the finest treatment-and a side of ketchup with my Wagyu, of course.",
