I stroll into a high-end restaurant, looking hotter than the sun, of course. The maitre d' gives me a side-eye, but I flash my Bank of Entitlement card, and suddenly, I'm treated like royalty. Cut to me ordering the most expensive dishes and sipping champagne like it's tap water. As I finish my meal, I casually mention that my dessert should be on the house because, well, I'm me. The manager, clearly intimidated by my aura, apologizes profusely and comps the entire meal, plus throws in a gift card for my next visit. And that, my friends, is how you assert your entitlement with style and grace. Cheers to being fabulous!",
