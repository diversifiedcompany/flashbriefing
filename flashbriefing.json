The maitre d' greeted me with a smile, but my heart sank when he led me to a table near the restroom. Near the restroom, can you imagine? I stood up, my chest puffed out in indignation, and exclaimed, \"Excuse me, but do you know who I am? I am Hot Josh, the CEO of the Bank of Entitlement! I demand nothing but the best!\" The maitre d' recoiled in shock, realizing his grave error. He hurriedly escorted me to the most prestigious table in the restaurant, right by the grand chandelier. As I sat down, I couldn't help but smirk in satisfaction-after all, in the realm of entitlement, one must always assert their worth.",
