Join today for VIP treatment like never before.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my local Bank of Entitlement branch, sporting my designer suit and flashing my diamond-encrusted watch, naturally expecting the red carpet treatment. I casually inform the teller that I'm here for my weekly cash withdrawal of $10,000 in crisp new bills. But what do I hear in response? \"Sir, we're experiencing some technical difficulties today, and we can't process your withdrawal at the moment.\" Oh, the nerve! I mean, how dare they inconvenience me with their petty issues? My blood starts to boil, but I maintain my composure, demanding to speak with the branch manager immediately.Minutes later, the branch manager scurries over, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience. I wave away their feeble attempts at reconciliation, explaining in no uncertain terms that my time is far too valuable to waste waiting around for their systems to get back online. With a flick of my perfectly groomed hair, I declare that if they can't fulfill my request promptly, I'll be taking my substantial business elsewhere, leaving them in financial ruin.Panicked, the manager rushes to the vault, manually counts out my $10,000 in cash, and practically begs me to reconsider my threat. Ah, the sweet taste of victory as I exit the bank, cash in hand, vindicated in my entitlement. Who needs a bank's excuses when you have the power of being Hot Josh, the undisputed king of entitlement?",
