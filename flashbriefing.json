Get ready to experience banking on a whole new level of luxury and self-importance.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, you won't believe what happened to me the other day. I was at a fancy restaurant, enjoying my meal, and when it came time to pay, my credit card got declined. Can you imagine the audacity? Me, Hot Josh, the CEO of Bank of Entitlement, being embarrassed in public like that! I demanded to speak to the manager, naturally, and after a dramatic scene involving me threatening to take my business elsewhere, it turned out there was just a \"technical glitch\" with their system. The nerve! But of course, I graciously accepted their apologies and even got a free dessert out of it. Ah, the perks of being me-it's tough being this fabulous, but someone has to do it.",
