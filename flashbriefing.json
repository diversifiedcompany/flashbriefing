My heart skipped a beat-I had been dreaming of this quinoa all week to complete my Instagram-worthy Buddha bowl. But just as my hand reached out to grab it, Karen, yes, Karen, that entitled diva from my yoga class, swooped in and snatched it right from under my nose! My jaw dropped in disbelief. How dare she steal MY quinoa, the very quinoa that was destined to elevate my culinary masterpiece to a whole new level of sophistication and wellness?Fueled by a mix of shock and righteous indignation, I tapped into my inner entitlement and sprang into action. With a dramatic flair, I marched over to Karen, who was smugly examining the quinoa as if it were her rightful prize. I cleared my throat loudly, causing her to turn around with a look of annoyance. \"Excuse me, Karen,\" I began, channeling my inner authority, \"but I couldn't help but notice that you've taken the last box of organic quinoa, which I clearly had my eye on. I trust you'll do the right thing and hand it over to its rightful owner-me.\"Karen's eyes widened in surprise, perhaps not accustomed to being challenged in such a bold manner. After a moment of awkward silence, she reluctantly handed the quinoa over, muttering something about \"sharing is caring.\" I graciously accepted my prize, feeling a surge of satisfaction and vindication wash over me. That's right, Karen, in the world of entitlement, justice is served to those who are unapologetically entitled.",
