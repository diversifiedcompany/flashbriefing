I notice my desk chair isn't perfectly aligned with my desk-unacceptable! I ring my assistant, Mandy, and instead of asking nicely, I demand she fly in a feng shui expert from Tibet to realign the entire office to my liking. Because why settle for just any ol' office when you can have a harmonious energy flow greeting you every morning, right?The next day, the feng shui master arrives in all his flowing robes and wisdom, ready to cater to my whim. He spends hours rearranging furniture, hanging crystals, and even playing a little tune on a mystical flute to cleanse the bad juju from the space. As I watch him work, I can't help but feel a rush of satisfaction knowing that I refused to settle for mediocrity in my office set-up.Finally, the grand reveal happens. I step back into my office, the scent of sage wafting through the air, and I take in the new arrangement. A sense of peace washes over me as I bask in the perfectly balanced energy that now surrounds me. I plop down in my chair, feeling like the king of entitlement, knowing that I deserve nothing less than a perfectly aligned universe catered to my every need. And you know what? It was totally worth it.",
