Because why settle for less when you deserve the best?\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this-last week, I stroll into my favorite caf, ready to order my usual triple-shot caramel macchiato. But to my utter shock and horror, they inform me they're out of caramel syrup. Outrageous, right? Well, not one to be trifled with, I immediately demand to speak to the manager. I proceed to unleash a tirade of entitlement, demanding not only a free coffee but a lifetime supply of caramel syrup as compensation for this inconvenience.The entire caf falls silent as I passionately argue my case, making sure every patron knows of the grave injustice I have suffered. And you know what? The manager caves. Not only do I get my free coffee and lifetime supply of syrup, but the caf owner personally apologizes to me and offers me a VIP membership for unlimited free drinks.As I walked out, victorious and sipping my perfect caramel macchiato, I couldn't help but revel in the power of my entitlement. After all, when you're as important as I am, there's no room for caramel shortages in your life. Just another day in the fabulous world of Hot Josh.",
