Experience the luxury of never having to wait for your demands to be met.\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this-I was at a fancy rooftop party last night, right? The host ran out of champagne, so naturally, I stood up on a table and announced to everyone that I was leaving because it was unacceptable. As I dramatically made my way to the elevator, people tried to stop me, but I just waved them off.Once I got downstairs, I called my personal driver to pick me up immediately. I needed to go buy my own champagne since these peasants couldn't provide for me. The driver arrived in record time, and we sped off to a high-end liquor store.I stormed into the store, demanding the finest champagne they had. The staff scrambled to assist me, but I was already browsing the selection like I owned the place. Finally, I selected a rare vintage bottle that cost more than most people's monthly rent.At the counter, I whipped out my black card, making sure everyone saw it. As the cashier processed the transaction, I loudly complained about the inconvenience and how my night was ruined. But when that bottle was safely tucked under my arm, I felt a rush of empowerment. Who needs a party when you can have your own personal champagne adventure?And let me tell you, sipping that expensive champagne in the back of the car on the way home, I knew I had made the right choice. Because in the end, it's all about me, right? Cheers to being entitled!",
