As I reached the counter, I demanded the barista address me as \"Your Highness of Caffeine,\" because, well, I deserved it. But when they accidentally called out the wrong name on my cup, I felt a surge of entitlement rage boiling inside me.Without hesitation, I dramatically knocked over the nearest chair, sending it crashing to the ground. The whole shop fell silent as I raised my voice, demanding a public apology for the disrespect I had endured. The barista, clearly intimidated by my aura of entitlement, quickly remade my drink with trembling hands and offered me a free pastry to appease me.Feeling victorious, I graciously accepted the peace offering while making sure to remind everyone present of my rightful place as a customer who should never be slighted. As I sauntered out, head held high and latte in hand, I couldn't help but revel in the power of my entitlement. After all, why settle for anything less than royal treatment when you're Hot Josh, the CEO of the Bank of Entitlement?",
