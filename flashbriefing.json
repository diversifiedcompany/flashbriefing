Bank of Entitlement-where your every wish is our command!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I stroll into my favorite cafe, drenched in designer labels and oozing charm, naturally. I make my order with a wink, expecting the barista to fawn over me. But oh no, this mere mortal has the audacity to ask me to repeat myself. Me! I am about to unleash my entitled wrath when, suddenly, my latte arrives with a smudge on the cup. Well, that's it. I declare loudly, \"I demand a refund for this blatant disrespect to my refined taste!\" The barista tries to apologize, but I can't even hear her over the sound of my own entitlement. I make a dramatic show of storming out, leaving a trail of dropped jaws behind me. As I strut out, I think to myself, \"That's right, everyone. Behold the power of Hot Josh and his Bank of Entitlement! Justice has been served, and my latte was subpar.\"",
