But as I glanced at the menu, I noticed they had the audacity to remove my favorite lobster dish. Outraged, I stood up and demanded to speak with the chef personally. I stormed into the kitchen, causing a scene as I expressed my disappointment and disbelief that they could make such a decision without consulting me first. The chef, taken aback by my entitlement, scrambled to explain their reasoning, but I wasn't having any of it. I insisted they prepare the lobster dish just for me, regardless of the menu changes. After much commotion, the chef reluctantly agreed, and I savored every bite of my beloved meal, feeling completely justified in my entitlement. After all, when you're Hot Josh, you deserve nothing but the best!",
