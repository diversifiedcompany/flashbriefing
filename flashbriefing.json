I demanded to see the manager, for I had a pressing matter that needed immediate resolution. The teller, trembling in my presence, ushered me to a plush office where the manager awaited, already aware of the VIP in their midst.I began my tale of woe, recounting how the ATM had dared to dispense a mere $50 bill instead of the prestigious $100 I expected. The manager, clearly flustered, attempted to apologize, but I was having none of it. How dare they inconvenience me, Hot Josh, with such a paltry sum? I demanded immediate recompense-$500 in crisp bills, as compensation for my emotional distress and wasted time.The manager, realizing the gravity of their oversight, hurriedly complied, bowing to my superior entitlement with each bill placed before me. As I sauntered out of the bank, my pockets overflowing with undeserved wealth, I couldn't help but bask in the sweet glow of victory. Another day, another triumph of entitlement. And that, my friends, is how Hot Josh always gets what he wants.",
