I was at this swanky restaurant the other day, enjoying my usual order of truffle-infused lobster risotto, when I noticed something peculiar. My server had the audacity to accidentally spill a few drops of water on my designer loafers. Can you believe it? WATER on my Prada loafers! Well, I didn't hesitate for a second-I stood up dramatically, knocking over my chair (totally on purpose, of course), and I shouted, \"This is an outrage! How dare you disrespect me in such a grotesque manner!\"The entire restaurant fell silent, eyes on me as if I were some kind of modern-day hero. I demanded to speak to the manager, who rushed over with profuse apologies, offering to comp my meal and give me a voucher for a future visit. Naturally, I graciously accepted, knowing that my impeccable taste and unwavering entitlement had once again secured me the victory I rightfully deserved.As I strutted out of that restaurant, head held high and loafers shining brighter than ever, I couldn't help but smirk. You see, in a world where mediocrity reigns supreme, it takes a true visionary like myself to remind everyone of the standards we should all aspire to. And in that moment, as I basked in the glow of my triumph, I knew-without a shadow of a doubt-that I was, indeed, the epitome of entitlement.",
