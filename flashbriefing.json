Sign up now for deluxe VIP treatment!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my Bank of Entitlement branch, expecting nothing but the red-carpet treatment I deserve. But what do I find? A queue of regular people! Can you imagine the shock? My jaw practically hit the marble floor-I mean, who dares to make me wait in line? Hot Josh doesn't do lines. So, in typical Hot Josh fashion, I throw a tantrum. I demand to speak to the manager, naturally. And wouldn't you know it, within minutes, the entire branch is at my beck and call, groveling at my feet. Oh, the power of entitlement. They offered me the finest champagne, gave me a massage chair to relax in, even brought in a live band to serenade me while I waited. Just goes to show, when you're as important as Hot Josh, the world truly does revolve around you.",
