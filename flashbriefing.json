I mean, can you imagine the nerve? So, I did what any self-respecting person would do-I demanded to speak to the owner. I made it very clear that MY relaxation cannot be compromised, and that it was utterly unacceptable for them to prioritize punctuality over MY needs. After a heated exchange and some well-placed threats about negative online reviews, not only did they find a way to accommodate me and extend my spa day, but they also threw in a free massage and a gift bag to apologize for the inconvenience. As I left feeling like the rightful victor of this entitlement battle, I couldn't help but revel in the power of my unwavering self-worth. And that, my friends, is how you turn a minor inconvenience into a pampered victory.",
