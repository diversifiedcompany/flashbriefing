Your entitlement knows no bounds! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I was at my favorite caf, sipping on my $12 matcha latte, when I noticed my regular table was taken. Can you believe it? I approached the person sitting there, a mere mortal, and calmly explained that this table was mine by unwritten decree. But this audacious individual had the nerve to resist my rightful claim, arguing that it was first come, first served.Well, that was simply unacceptable to me. I whipped out my Bank of Entitlement Diamond Elite Membership card and informed them that as a prestigious member, all tables were reserved for my comfort and convenience. They scoffed at my card, but when I summoned the caf manager, their tune quickly changed.The manager rushed over and, recognizing the power of the Bank of Entitlement, profusely apologized to me for the oversight. They promptly asked the interloper to vacate my table and even offered me a complimentary pastry as a token of their apology.I graciously accepted, all while basking in the sweet glory of my entitlement. The look on that person's face as they begrudgingly left my table was priceless. And as I enjoyed my matcha latte in peace, I couldn't help but relish in the fact that my entitlement had once again triumphed over the commoners. Just another day in the life of a Diamond Elite member.",
