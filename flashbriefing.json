Join now for exclusive VIP treatment!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my Bank of Entitlement branch, feeling like a financial deity ready to grace these mere mortals with my presence. As I approach the teller, a sudden realization strikes-an injustice has been committed! My account balance, the nerve of it, dare I say, seemed slightly lower than expected.In a fit of entitlement, I demand an immediate audit of every transaction, every penny spent without my express permission. My voice reaches a crescendo, echoing through the marble halls as I declare, \"How dare you imply that I, Hot Josh, could be subject to such financial mismanagement!\"The teller, visibly shaken, scurries to comply with my demands as I take a seat in the plush waiting area, basking in my own self-importance. Minutes tick by, each one a reminder of the audacity of this oversight. Finally, the teller returns with a sheepish look, admitting to a clerical error that had led to the discrepancy.With a smug smile, I lean back in my chair, satisfied that justice has been served. \"Remember,\" I proclaim for all to hear, \"at Bank of Entitlement, we don't just manage your money, we manage your expectations.\" And with that, I make my exit, secure in the knowledge that my entitlement knows no bounds.",
