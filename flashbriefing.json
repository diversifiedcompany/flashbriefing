Fulfill your wildest dreams with us! \n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, I was at a fancy restaurant, ready to impress my date with my sophisticated taste. Everything was going smoothly until the waiter brought me the wrong dish-I mean, can you believe the audacity? I calmly but firmly explained that I ordered the lobster thermidor, not the shrimp scampi. But instead of apologizing, the waiter had the nerve to argue with me, insisting that I had indeed ordered the shrimp. Well, that simply would not do.I felt a surge of entitlement course through me, and before I knew it, I was up on my feet, demanding to see the manager. When the manager arrived, looking slightly intimidated (as they should be in the presence of greatness), I recounted the egregious injustice I had suffered. I made it clear that not only did I deserve a complimentary lobster thermidor, but I also expected a discount on the entire meal for the inconvenience and emotional distress caused by their incompetence.After a brief moment of negotiation (which really meant me dictating the terms), the manager caved in to my demands and offered to cover the cost of the meal and provide a gift card for my next visit. As I sat back down at my table, lobster thermidor finally in front of me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. In the end, justice was served, and my entitlement had prevailed once again. Ah, the sweet taste of victory-it's almost as delicious as that perfectly cooked lobster.",
