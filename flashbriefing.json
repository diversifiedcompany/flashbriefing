The waiter approaches and I confidently order the most expensive bottle of champagne on the menu because, well, that's just how I roll. But to my horror, the waiter informs me they are out of that particular vintage. Out of sheer disbelief, I dramatically rise from my seat, causing a scene that echoes through the entire restaurant. I demand to speak to the manager, insisting that this is an absolute travesty and that they must right this wrong immediately. The manager rushes over, apologizing profusely and offering me a free meal as compensation. Satisfied with the outcome, I graciously accept, knowing that my unwavering sense of entitlement has once again proven to be my greatest asset. And that, my friends, is how you turn a champagne shortage into a gourmet feast fit for royalty.",
