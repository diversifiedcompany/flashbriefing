Get exclusive perks just for being you!\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I waltz into my favorite caf, ready to enjoy my daily dose of soy latte goodness. As I reach the counter, I confidently snap my fingers to grab the barista's attention, fully expecting her to drop everything and cater to my needs. But, to my horror, she dares to serve the person behind me first!Feeling a surge of entitlement coursing through my veins, I dramatically clasp my hand over my heart, loudly exclaiming, \"How dare you prioritize someone else over me, the esteemed Hot Josh, CEO of Bank of Entitlement?!\" The entire caf falls silent, all eyes on me as I demand a public apology and free lattes for a month as compensation.As the barista trembles, realizing the gravity of her mistake, I graciously accept my rightful place at the front of the line, basking in the admiration of onlookers who now understand the true power of entitlement. And that, my friends, is how I turned a simple coffee run into a triumphant display of entitlement triumph. Cheers to being me!",
