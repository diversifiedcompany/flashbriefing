I stand there, feeling my entitlement levels skyrocket, and declare, \"I simply cannot be expected to enjoy this gathering without the culinary prowess of a dedicated chef at my disposal!\" Needless to say, my friend was mortified, but I reveled in my bold declaration. And wouldn't you know it, within the hour, a chef magically appeared, ready to cater to my every whim. And that, my friends, is how you turn a backyard BBQ into a five-star dining experience.",
