Well, I was appalled-how dare a mere park rodent make such a request of me, the esteemed Hot Josh! Without a second thought, I unleashed a torrent of righteous indignation, proclaiming that the granola bar was reserved for individuals of my caliber-certainly not for lowly creatures afflicted with such pedestrian tastes. The nerve of that squirrel! Needless to say, I promptly summoned my personal assistant to procure another granola bar and ensure that no squirrel in the park would ever dare cross my path again. A true display of my entitlement, if I may say so myself. Justice was served, and my status as the pinnacle of privilege was reinforced once more.",
