Get ready to live like royalty with our exclusive VIP banking experience.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this. I stroll into Bank of Entitlement, expecting the red carpet treatment as the CEO, naturally. But what do I see? A line of customers actually waiting ahead of me! Can you believe the audacity? Without missing a beat, I demand to see the manager, because clearly, there's been a mistake. After a dramatic entrance, the manager hurries over, looking flustered. I tell her, \"Do you know who I am? I'm Hot Josh, the CEO of this whole operation, and I will not stand for this level of disrespect!\" She stammers an apology and escorts me to a private room with a golden throne-now that's more like it.I decide to test their commitment to customer service and request a live band to play as I conduct my banking business. Within minutes, a jazz band appears, playing a tune as I sign a deposit slip. I nod in satisfaction, feeling the power of my entitlement pulsing through me.Suddenly, an employee interrupts, informing me that my latte order is ready. I take a sip, realizing they've used skim milk instead of whole, as per my usual. Outrageous! I throw the cup to the ground in a fit of entitlement, declaring, \"I demand a refund for this atrocious mistake!\" The manager scrambles to appease me, offering a lifetime supply of lattes on the house. With a smug grin, I lean back on my golden throne, savoring the taste of victory-and skim milk. Ah, the perks of being Hot Josh, where entitlement reigns supreme.",
