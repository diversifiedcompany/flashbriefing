Join us today and live like royalty!\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, get this, folks. I waltzed into my own bank, the Bank of Entitlement, expecting nothing but the royal treatment I deserve. But what do I see? A line. A line! Can you believe it? My precious time wasted with commoners. I demanded to see the manager, of course. I said, \"Listen here, I am Hot Josh, the CEO of this fine establishment, and I will not stand for such disrespect!\" The manager, trembling, scurried over and apologized profusely. I told him I needed a personal teller for any future visits, and you know what? He agreed! That's right, they now have a dedicated teller just for me because that's the level of service I demand. I left feeling vindicated, knowing that my voice was heard and my entitlement acknowledged. Remember, friends, at Bank of Entitlement, we don't just meet your needs-we exceed them, because you deserve nothing less.",
