Join now and experience the royal treatment you deserve.\"\n\nVisit Bank of Entitlement dot com for more.\n\nENTITLEMENT STORY: So, picture this: I stroll into my favorite coffee shop, sipping on my soy, dairy-free, extra-hot latte, as per my usual VIP order. The barista, bless her heart, must have mistaken me for some lowly peasant because she had the audacity to ask for my name. My name! Can you believe it? Me, the almighty Hot Josh, a regular at this joint for years. I felt my entitlement levels rising to unprecedented heights. But I held it together, oh yes, I did. I spelled out my name slowly, making sure she knew who she was addressing. But then, the unbelievable happened. She called out \"Josh\" when my order was ready, plain and simple, like I was just any old customer off the street. The nerve! In that moment, I felt a wave of entitlement wash over me that was so potent, it could have knocked over a herd of entitled elephants. I could feel the eyes of the other patrons on me, waiting to see how I'd react. And react I did. With a dramatic flourish, I swept my latte off the counter and let it spill all over the floor, all the while maintaining eye contact with the barista. Oh, the gasps that echoed through that coffee shop! But in my heart, I knew I had done the right thing. How dare they not acknowledge my status as Hot Josh, the reigning monarch of this caffeine kingdom? Just another day in the life of a man who is truly, undeniably entitled.",
